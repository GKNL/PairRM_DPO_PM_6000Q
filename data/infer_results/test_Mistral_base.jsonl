{"question": "If user input is inserted without modification into an SQL query, then the application becomes vulnerable to SQL injection, like in the following example:\n```$unsafe_variable = $_POST['user_input'];\nmysql_query(\"INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES ('$unsafe_variable')\");\n```\nThat's because the user can input something like ```value'); DROP TABLE table;--```, and the query becomes:\n```INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES('value'); DROP TABLE table;--')\n```\nWhat can be done to prevent this from happening?", "answer": "The correct way to avoid SQL injection attacks, no matter which database you use, is to separate the data from SQL, so that data stays data and will never be interpreted as commands by the SQL parser. It is possible to create an SQL statement with correctly formatted data parts, but if you don't fully understand the details, you should always use prepared statements and parameterized queries. These are SQL statements that are sent to and parsed by the database server separately from any parameters. This way it is impossible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL.\n\nYou basically have two options to achieve this:\n\n1. Using PDO (for any supported database driver):\n```\n$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');\n$stmt->execute([ 'name' => $name ]);\n\nforeach ($stmt as $row) {\n    // Do something with $row\n}\n```\n\n2. Using MySQLi (for MySQL):\nSince PHP 8.2+ we can make use of execute_query() which prepares, binds parameters, and executes SQL statement in one method:\n```\n$result = $dbConnection->execute_query('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?', [$name]);\n\nwhile ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    // Do something with $row\n}\n```\n\nUp to PHP8.1:\n```\n$stmt = $dbConnection->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?');\n$stmt->bind_param('s', $name); // 's' specifies the variable type => 'string'\n$stmt->execute();\n\n$result = $stmt->get_result();\nwhile ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    // Do something with $row\n}\n```\nIf you're connecting to a database other than MySQL, there is a driver-specific second option that you can refer to (for example, pg_prepare() and pg_execute() for PostgreSQL). PDO is the universal option.", "base_prediction": "To prevent SQL injection attacks, you should never insert user input directly into an SQL query without proper validation and sanitization. Here's how you can do it instead:\n\n1. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries. Prepared statements are precompiled SQL statements where placeholders are used for values that will be provided later. When you execute a prepared statement, you pass the values as separate arguments, which are then automatically escaped and validated by the database. This way, even if an attacker sends malicious input, the database will not interpret it as SQL code.\n\nHere's an example using prepared statements in PHP and MySQL:\n\n```php\n<?php\n$stmt = $pdo->prepare(\"INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES (:value)\");\n$stmt->bindParam(':value', $user_input);\n$user_input = $_POST['user_input'];\n$stmt->execute();\n?>\n```\n\n2. Validate and sanitize user input. Even with prepared statements, it's important to validate user input before inserting it into the query. You can check that the input conforms to the expected format and length, and sanitize it by removing any characters that are not allowed in the database. This can be done using regular expressions, string functions, or built-in validation functions, depending on the language or framework you're using.\n\nHere's an example of sanitizing user input using PHP's `filter_var()` function and a custom regex:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Sanitize user input using a custom regex pattern\n$user_input = filter_var($_POST['user_input'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING, array('options' => array('regexp' => '/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/')));\n// Validate user input against a certain format or length\nif (preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/', $user_input) && strlen($user_input) <= 50) {\n    $stmt = $pdo->prepare(\"INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES (:value)\");\n    $stmt->bindParam(':value', $user_input);\n    $stmt->execute();\n} else {\n    // Handle validation errors, for example by displaying an error message or logging the error\n}\n?>\n```\n\nBy using prepared statements and validating and sanitizing user input, you can safely insert user input into an SQL query without risking SQL injection attacks."}

It was home to thousands of alternative history books, each one offering glimpses into what could have been if the course of history had been altered. Among the most highly sought after were those that detailed the outcomes of World War II had the Allies won instead of the Axis powers.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, two library patrons, Anna, a young history professor, and Michael, a retired engineer, sat side by side, engrossed in the same book. Their eyes widened with every page, and their hearts swelled with the sense of relief and hope that unfolded before them. This alternate history told of a post-war world where the Nazis had lost and Europe was rebuilding itself from the ashes of conflict.\n\nAnna leaned over to Michael, her voice hardly above a whisper, \"Imagine if we could go there, to this parallel world where the Allies won.\"\n\nMichael's eyes gleamed with excitement, \"Indeed! What if we could gather a team and make it our mission to seek out the counterparts of the groundbreaking scientists and artists who were persecuted by the Nazis in our world and bring their stories to light?\"\n\nA thrilling idea ignited between them, and so they began their journey to what they would come to call the \"Parallel World.\" They gathered a team of like-minded individuals: Emma, a renowned physicist; Thomas, a brave pilot; and Marie, a brilliant mathematician. Together they embarked on a daring adventure to breach the barrier between the worlds and change the course of history in their own.\n\nTheir journey towards the Parallel World was filled with challenges and suspense, but eventually, they succeeded in crossing over. They found themselves in a world where Germany had been defeated, and Europe was thriving. As they began their new lives, they devoted themselves to finding and aiding their counterparts – the scientists, artists, and intellectuals who had been persecuted, exiled, or silenced in their world.\n\nAmong the most remarkable figures they encountered were Lise Meitner, a brilliant physicist who had been instrumental in the discovery of nuclear fission; Klara Danwitz, a painter whose works had been banned and destroyed; and Anne Frank, a writer whose diary was a poignant testament to the lives of Jews during the war.\n\nIn the Parallel World, these individuals had been free to live out their lives, their talents acknowledged and celebrated. Anna, Michael, Emma, Thomas, and Marie worked tirelessly to ensure their counterparts received the recognition they deserved. They published their research, organized exhibitions of their artwork, and even helped establish scholarships and grants in their names.\n\nThe team's work had far-reaching consequences. They not only brought about justice and recognition to these talented individuals but also fostered a spirit of unity and collaboration between the worlds. The people of the Parallel World were moved by the stories of their counterparts in their world – ordinary people who had refused to succumb to the darkness that threatened to engulf the entire continent.\n\nThe years passed, and the team disbanded as their individual projects came to fruition. Anna and Michael remained in the Parallel World, having grown to love it and the people they had come to call their friends. They continued to work together, writing books and sharing their findings with the world, so that their parallel lives might serve as a reminder of the extraordinary power of the human spirit in the face of adversity.\n\nBoth worlds, bound by the intertwining fates of their inhabitants, would never be the same. A testament to the resilience and courage of the human spirit, their stories became a beacon of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, the light still shines, and the power to change the course of history lies within each one of us."}
{"question": "In India, we eat rice using our fingers. Generally in the West, a fork or spoon is used. I have tried eating rice with spoon but I don't feel satisfied with it.\nWe eat dry rice but we mix curry and vegetables with it and then eat it with our hands.\nIs there a way to eat rice with your hands in front of Westerners such that it doesn't appear to be disgusting to them? By disgusting I mean that they shouldn't feel like vomiting or looking away to avoid me. Even though in India we eat with our fingers, many people eat such that their whole palm is covered with food. That indeed looks disgusting. \nI cannot avoid hurting them by following different etiquette, but I certainly want to maintain a degree of cleanliness.", "answer": "First and foremost, you can eat the way you want. When it comes to western culture, the only thing that is generally disliked are noises, eating with the mouth wide open (included speaking with full mouth), and (excessively) dirtying the table. Eating rice with hands will be seen (mostly) as strange, not disgusting.\n\nSecond, context. Are you eating at a formal dinner with your colleagues and a client? Eat with the fork, as everybody else. Are you eating at the work's canteen? Eat the way you prefer and let other deal with their limits. And so on.\n\nThird, respect and open mindness: you are worried other peoples find you disgusting for eating rice with hands, but at the same time you show the same \"closed mind\" (in a way, ok? I'm not trying to offend you) in wanting to eat rice with hands at all cost otherwise you will not feel satisfied; believe me, eating with a fork will not starve you as will not change food nutritional content.\n\nEven more if you are eating at a foreign restaurant, e.g. at an italian restaurant rice is cooked and thought to be eatean with a fork. Respect local culture, open yourself to a new experience, and try to learn a different way to enjoy food.\n\nIn the end: feel free to do whatever fit you most, don't be afraid of other people judging you (their fault), but at the same time don't close yourself in your garden (your fault).", "base_prediction": "Eating rice with your hands in front of Westerners may seem unusual to them, but with some considerations, you can make it more acceptable and minimize any potential discomfort or disgust. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Use a clean plate and utensils: Set up a clean plate with rice and place any curries or vegetables on a separate plate or bowl using clean utensils. This will give the impression that you are practicing good hygiene and are not just eating directly from a communal dish.\n\n2. Wash and dry your hands: Before eating, make sure you wash and dry your hands thoroughly. Provide water and towels or napkins for your guests as well to create a similar experience.\n\n3. Use the right part of your hand: Make sure you only use the right hand for eating, keeping your left hand for cleaning your face, as is customary in Indian cuisine.\n\n4. Minimize the amount of food on your hands: Be mindful of not overloading your hands with too much food, which may appear messy or unsanitary to Westerners. Use a reasonable amount of rice and eat it gently without making a mess.\n\n5. Use a cloth napkin or tissue: Place a clean cloth napkin or tissue on the table for guests, allowing them to wipe their hands as needed to make them feel more comfortable.\n\n6. Offer cutlery as an alternative: Provide cutlery for those who may prefer not to eat with their hands. This will accommodate their preferences and make them feel more at ease.\n\n7. Use proper table manners: Use a tablecloth, sit properly at the table, and maintain good table manners, such as keeping elbows off the table and not talking with food in your mouth.\n\n8. Explain the culture behind it: Take the opportunity to explain the cultural significance of eating with your hands in Hinduism and other Indian traditions. This can help your guests better understand the practice and appreciate its importance to you and your heritage."}
{"question": "How to deal with diagnosis of a rare chromosome disorder in a child?", "answer": "Most people have heard of Down syndrome. But there are hundreds of other chromosome disorders a child can have, many of which are diagnosed in only a few children, or may even be unique to that child.\n\n## Get information\n\n1. Learn about genetics. Most people have 46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. One pair is the sex chromosomes, which in males is usually XY and in females XX. The other 22 pairs, known as autosomes, are numbered by size, with chromosome 1 being the biggest. Each chromosome has a longer arm, called the q arm, and a shorter arm, called the p arm. Each arm has bands that are numbered, with the band closest to the middle (centromere) being numbered 11.1. Terminus (shortened to \"ter\") refers to a tip of a chromosome. A \"terminal\" chromosome disorder is not fatal; it just involves the terminus. Learn about the types of changes. Nullisomy means that there are zero copies of a chromosome. Deletion/monosomy means that there is only one copy of the chromosome or piece of chromosome. Duplication/trisomy means that there are 3 copies. Tetrasomy and pentasomy refer to 4 and 5 copies, respectively. Translocations are when chromosomes swap material. If it is balanced, this means the same number of copies of material is present, but they are arranged differently - for example they have part of 3q on 2q and part of 2q on 3q, but it all adds up to the same thing. If it is unbalanced, the child has trisomy and/or monosomy for some part of the involved chromosomes. Very often, an unbalanced translocation is inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation, but it can also occur as a new mutation, which is called 'de novo'. For example, they may have part of 2q missing and part of 3q in its place, causing partial monosomy of 2q and partial trisomy of 3q. In an unbalanced translocation, the abnormal chromosome is called the derivative chromosome, or der for short. So they may write t(2;3)der(2) to indicate the child has the 2 with chromosome 3 material instead of the 3 with chromosome 2 material.\n2. Find medical information on your child's condition. There may not be much out there, but find what you can, because it can give you an idea what to expect for your child. Be careful to pay attention to what specific chromosome region is affected, including what bands are involved - even though they both have 22q deletion, kids with 22q11 deletion have a totally different syndrome from 22q13 deletion. Also keep in mind duplication/trisomy versus deletion/monosomy, because these are genetic opposites. When reading medical case studies, remember that they focus on the negative. You're probably not going to hear the doctor talk about how sweet and caring the child is, or how much their parents feel lucky for knowing them, because it's not medically relevant. You will learn about some of the health problems your kid could face.\n3. See if parents have written about your child's condition. Depending on how rare the condition is, there may be other parents out there who have written about what it is like to raise a child who has it.\n4. Look for adults with your child's condition. Many adults with genetic disabilities are able to use computers when they become adults. Do any of them have blogs or social media accounts? They may be able to offer good advice. Here are some benefits of learning from adults with disabilities:\n\t* They can tell you about the parenting strategies that did and didn't help. They may be able to offer detailed advice about your child. Watching them can help you envision what your child's life will be like someday.\n\n\n## Cop\n\n1. Don't assume the worst. Many doctors, when they don't know the prognosis for a condition, will act like it's more severe than it really is. Even parents of kids with very mild chromosome disorders have been told their child will never walk or talk and/or will die in infancy. If your child has a rare syndrome, take dire prognoses with a grain of salt.\n2. Recognize that infancy is the worst time. For many chromosomal conditions, the first year or two of life are the hardest, as caregivers and healthcare providers try to figure out the child's needs. It won't always be this bad, and it's likely to get easier. If you've been told that your child may die, recognize that extreme early death usually happens in the first 3 years of life, or not at all. If your child is fine at age 4, they'll probably be fine at age 24 and age 44.\n3. Give yourself time to process. You may feel a range of emotions as you realize that your child's life will look different than you thought it would. This is normal. Don't expect yourself to adjust immediately.\n4. Tell other people how they can support you. People around you may want to help, but not know what they can do. Let them know what your family needs, and give them the opportunity to help. \"Between all the doctor appointments, we barely have time to cook. It would be really nice to have someone prepare a meal or maybe invite us for dinner once in a while.\" \"We could really use a babysitter on weekends.\" \"We're so busy for with the baby that the kids can feel left out. If they could go to your house to play with your kids sometimes, it might help cheer them up.\" \"I'm really worried about the upcoming surgery. My wife can't be there due to her conference. It would really help to have someone there with me.\"\n5. Make peace with the fact that life will be different. Your child is going to learn differently, behave differently, and show you how much they love you differently. Sometimes it will be harder, but there will also be beautiful parts. Remember that not every quirk is a deficit. Some differences are positives, and others are neither good nor bad. It's okay for your child to be unique.\n6. Take time for yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup, and you can't help your child much if you're physically and emotionally exhausted. Try to set aside a little \"me time\" each day, even if it's only 5 minutes. Ask yourself \"What would help me feel better right now?\" Could it be a shower? A cup of tea? A hug? Try to get it.\n\n\n## Move forward\n\n1. Seek out parent support groups. If you can find other parents of kids with the same or overlapping chromosome disorders, great, but even parents of kids with completely different conditions can be a great source of support. UNIQUE has leaflets on many rare conditions.\n2. Get therapy early. Early intervention is important. As soon as your child is medically stable, sign them up for physical, occupational and/or speech therapy - even if they are still a tiny baby. This will help them reach their full potential. Although very few kids with chromosome disorders are so affected that they can't walk or talk, most have some degree of cognitive or learning disability. The more they can do for themselves, the less support they will need from others in adulthood. Take notes during therapy and ask for activities that you can do at home. Bad therapists do exist. If a therapist tells you to be cruel or punitive towards your child, find a new therapist. Childhood should be fun, not scary. You don't want your child to gain an anxiety disorder along with their new skills.\n3. Make time for your child's siblings, if there are any. At times, they may feel left out, especially if you're busy taking care of your disabled child's needs. Try to spend quality time with each of your children every day. If you don't spend time with a child on one day, try to make up for it during the weekend.\n4. Celebrate your child! Your child is different, and they have their own special combination of traits that make them who they are. Love them for who they are, and treasure the good moments. Some conditions, such as Williams syndrome, include positive aspects. Let go of the idea of the child you could have had, and focus on the real child you have right now. They need your love.\n", "base_prediction": "Receiving a diagnosis of a rare chromosome disorder for a child can be overwhelming and emotional for parents. Here are some steps you can take to cope with the diagnosis and provide the best possible care for your child:\n\n1. Seek out reliable information: It's important to get accurate and up-to-date information about your child's condition from reliable sources, such as medical organizations, genetic counselors, and healthcare professionals. This will help you better understand the condition, its causes, and potential treatments.\n2. Connect with support groups: Consider joining a support group or connecting with other families who have children with the same condition. They can provide emotional support, practical advice, and valuable insights into managing the condition. Look for local or online support groups, and consider joining organizations advocating for people with the condition.\n3. Work with healthcare professionals: Work closely with your child's healthcare team to develop a comprehensive care plan. This may include specialists in genetics, pediatrics, therapy, and education. Together, you can create a personalized plan for managing your child's condition, including regular check-ups, treatments, and therapies.\n4. Advocate for your child: Advocate for your child's needs in school and in healthcare settings. Make sure they receive the accommodations and services they need to thrive. This may include special education services, accommodations in the classroom, or therapies to help them reach their full potential.\n5. Explore resources and services: Look for resources and services that may be able to help you and your family. This can include financial assistance, grants for medical expenses, equipment, or home modifications. There may also be resources available for respite care and support for siblings.\n6. Prioritize self-care: Caring for a child with a rare chromosome disorder can be emotionally and physically taxing. Prioritize self-care activities to help you stay healthy and better able to support your child. This may include regular exercise, getting enough sleep, eating well, and connecting with friends and family for support.\n7. Seek out counseling or therapy: If you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope with the diagnosis, consider seeking out counseling or therapy to help you process your emotions and develop coping strategies. This can be a valuable resource for both you and your child."}
{"question": "I am writing a story where a species undergoes devolution. Is there any scientific or plausible way to do this? The process can be instantaneous or may take ages, I do not mind which as I need to weigh my options at this stage. \nTo be clear, the devolution I am thinking of is like taking a human being then devolving him/her to the primate stage, so lets say about as far back as Orrorin tugenensis or Paranthropus where they are in the midst of evolving from primates to Homo erectus. Please note I used human beings as an example to give context but the species undergoing devolution may not necessarily be human.\nBased on the answers, \"devolution\" does not exist so had the word in quotes to reflect this. ", "answer": "Devolution doesn't really ever occur, organisms simply adapt to best suit their environment over time. A good example is cave dwelling Troglodyte type species that have lost the ability to see. They haven't actually devolved to not have eyes, they simply did not need them and evolved to save valuable energy and nutrients by not growing a sight organ that would be useless in their environment. It isn't devolution, it's still evolution since they are changing to better suit their environment. So, at least as far as natural processes go, a species would need to become stuck in an environment for a few hundred thousand years that heavily discourages intellect, sociability, communication skills, culture, and inventiveness. That's a tough one to come up with since such traits are usually the most powerful ones for surviving something.\n\nSo here's the environment and scenario I'm thinking of. Your smart guy race is in the stone age, its pretty much on par with homo sapiens and where they were at about 10,000-15,000 years ago. But something catastrophic doesn't happen. The world slowly becomes a perfect Eden with very few predators, a perfect climate, and vast endless fields of grain and forests of fruit bearing trees. No ice age, no super-predators like we saw in said ice age. No famines or depredation, no rabid competition between several human subspecies for the same resources. The planet (Henceforth known as paradise) is literally perfect. Too perfect. Why would a species that has as close as possible to absolutely nothing to worry about need to even develop the ability to worry? Those big craniums and complex brains waste space and make childbirth more dangerous than necessary. There is absolutely nothing gained by possessing speech, abstract thought, or cooperative culture when all a species needs to do to be successful is to wander around placidly in small familial groups grazing mindlessly on the limitless amounts of food. Shelter is utterly not necessary since you have a perfect climate, nor is clothing, and food is so ludicrously plentiful there is no need to make tools. Within another 100,000 years your species that was formerly well on their way to developing things like agriculture, warfare, and tribal societies has reverted back to dumb grazers that simply live to eat and reproduce.", "base_prediction": "In the context of your story, the concept of a species undergoing \"devolution\" is not scientifically valid. The term \"devolution\" is often used incorrectly to describe a process in which a species becomes less complex or advanced. However, from an evolutionary perspective, the only direction for a species is forward, not backward.\n\nEvolution is a process of change in the heritable traits of a population over successive generations. It is driven by natural selection, which favors traits that increase an organism's chances of survival and reproduction. Over long periods of time, this process can lead to the emergence of new species through the branches of the evolutionary tree.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the process of evolution is not always inexorable and straightforward. There are many factors that can influence the direction and rate of evolution, including mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and environmental pressures. In some cases, these forces can result in the loss of traits that are no longer advantageous, or the emergence of new traits that are beneficial in a changed environment.\n\nBut a meaningful loss of traits that would take a species back to an earlier evolutionary stage, let's say from a modern human to a primate, is not supported by scientific evidence. While it is true that modern humans and primates share a common ancestor, and there are similarities between the two groups, the process of evolution since that common ancestor has led to many differences.\n\nThere are, however, some rare cases of regression or \"reverse evolution\" in which a trait or organ appears in an otherwise advanced species. For example, the elbow joint appears in some snakes, which are otherwise limbless. But such examples are exceptions, and they do not result in a net loss of complexity or a regression to an earlier evolutionary stage.\n\nIf you are looking to create a plausible scenario for a species undergoing a loss of complexity in your story, you may want to explore causes for the loss of certain traits, rather than a meaningful devolution. For example, you could consider environmental pressures, lack of genetic diversity, or other external factors that could lead a species to lose certain traits over time."}
{"question": "Betty has a tray of cookies and a tray of brownies. She has a real sweet tooth and eats 3 cookies a day and 1 brownie a day. If she starts with 60 cookies and 10 brownies, how many more cookies than brownies does she have after a week of eating like this?", "answer": "Here is the solution step by step:\n\nFirst we find how many cookies Betty will eat in a week by multiplying her daily amount by 7, meaning 7*3= 21 cookies eaten in a week.\nWe repeat this for the brownies, finding she eats 7*1= 7 brownies in a week.\nWe subtract the 21 cookies from the original amount of 60, finding 60-21= 39 cookies remaining.\nWe repeat this step for the brownies, finding 10-7= 3 brownies remaining.\nIn the end, therefore, Betty has 39-3= 36 more cookies than brownies.", "base_prediction": "Betty eats 3 cookies and 1 brownie each day, so in one day she consumes:\n\nDaily consumption = Cookies eaten per day + Brownies eaten per day\n= 3 cookies + 1 brownie\n= 4 items\n\nTo find out how many items Betty consumes in a week, we multiply her daily consumption by the number of days in a week (7):\n\nWeekly consumption = Daily consumption * Days per week\n= 4 items/day * 7 days\n= 28 items\n\nSince Betty starts with 60 cookies and 10 brownies, we find out how many of each item she consumes during a week:\n\nConsumed cookies = Weekly consumption * Number of cookies\n= 28 items * 3 cookies/item\n= 84 cookies\n\nConsumed brownies = Weekly consumption * Number of brownies\n= 28 items * 1 brownie/item\n= 28 brownies\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the number of cookies and brownies Betty has eaten during a week:\n\nDifference = Cookies eaten - Brownies eaten\n= 84 cookies - 28 brownies\n= 56 cookies\n\nBetty consumes 56 more cookies than brownies during a week."}
{"question": "Is there a Git for data? The key improvement I'd want is to Diff/Merge more intelligently. e.g. in CSV rather than line vs line comparison, it would do cell vs cell.\nAnd ordering is usually not significant, e.g. rows in a CSV, whereas Git does care and presents the user with 'conflicts'.", "answer": "Please note that ```git``` has two configuration commands:\n```git config filter..clean\ngit config filter..smudge\n```\nThe ```clean``` filter can be used e.g. to sort all records in a CSV file except the top row, thus making re-ordering irrelevant.\nQuoting ```gitattributes(5)``` :\n\nA filter driver consists of a clean command and a smudge command, either of which can be left unspecified. Upon checkout, when the smudge command is specified, the command is fed the blob object from its standard input, and its standard output is used to update the worktree file. Similarly, the clean command is used to convert the contents of worktree file upon checkin.\nA missing filter driver definition in the config is not an error but makes the filter a no-op passthru.\nThe content filtering is done to massage the content into a shape that is more convenient for the platform, filesystem, and the user to use. The key phrase here is &quot;more convenient&quot; and not &quot;turning something unusable into usable&quot;. In other words, the intent is that if someone unsets the filter driver definition, or does not have the appropriate filter program, the project should still be usable.\n", "base_prediction": "While Git is primarily designed for versioning and tracking changes in source code, there are tools that aim to provide similar functionality for data files, including CSV files. One such tool is called \"Git Large File Storage\" (LFS), which is an extension for Git that allows you to manage large binary files more efficiently, including CSV files.\n\nHowever, Git LFS itself does not offer cell- level Diff and Merge for CSV files out-of-the-box. For that specific requirement, there are other tools and libraries that can be used in combination with Git.\n\nOne popular tool is named \"dsdiff\" (Data Structures Differ), which can be used to perform a more intelligent comparison and merge of structured data like CSV files. This tool generates patch files that include cell-level changes as well as the ability to handle complex data structures like nested structures.\n\nAnother tool is called \"opendiff with csvmerge,\" where opendiff is a popular graphical merge tool, and csvmerge is a command-line CSV merge tool designed specifically for CSV files. You can use both tools together to compare and merge CSV files with more advanced features.\n\nIt's worth noting that using these tools with Git might require additional workflows and configuration to manage the data versions through Git. For more complex use cases, consider using dedicated data versioning systems, like Apache Airflow's GitOperators, or data orchestration platforms like dagster or Apache NiFi, which have built-in diffing and merging capabilities for data."}
{"question": "How to treat ocd and anxiety as a workaholic?", "answer": "Working too much is a serious problem. Often, people who work too much also suffer from OCD or related anxiety disorders. If you work too much and suffer from an anxiety disorder, there are several things you can do to lead a more balanced life. You can start by seeing your doctor and going to therapy. Lifestyle changes, such as adopting stress-relieving techniques, making work boundaries, and managing your anxiety or OCD, are also important.\n\n## Manage your anxiety disorder\n\n1. Make a self-care plan. To improve your relationship with work and alleviate anxiety or OCD symptoms, you can develop a self-care plan that covers every area of your life. If you are obsessed with working, the rest of your life may be neglected. A self-care plan helps you balance your life and pay attention to each part of your life. Your self-care plan can focus on work, relationships, leisure time, the self, and your spiritual life. By breaking down your life into concrete categories, you can see where you are lacking and what needs improvement. For example, you may have 90% of your energy into your work. Your self-care plan allows you to schedule an hour each evening for leisure, where you watch television, an hour of exercise to focus on yourself, and two hours to spend with your family. On the weekends, you spend Saturday with your family and friends, and Sunday you focus on yourself. Start working on balancing your life. All of your energy now is focused on work. You should think about what’s important to you, like family and friend relationships or improving your leisure time. Put more effort into those areas of your life and less into work. Becoming more balanced in your life, improving relationships, and working on yourself can help reduce stress that leads to anxiety and OCD.\n2. Get enough sleep. Many people who work all of the time don’t sleep enough because they are too busy working. This can worsen anxiety and OCD symptoms, making you feel even worse. Worsening anxiety and OCD symptoms may also affect your work quality. To help with this, strive to get into a healthy sleep routine. Most people need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. You should go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning. This helps you adopt healthy sleeping habits.\n3. Take stress-relief breaks during the day. If you are spending all of your time focusing on work, your stress levels may be extremely high. This can increase your anxiety or OCD symptoms. To help alleviate your anxiety, take small breaks from work throughout the day to relieve stress. For example, take a 10 minute walk around the building or block. Exercise can help boost your mood and improve your anxiety. Go to lunch with coworkers or friends. Spending time connecting with people can help reduce anxiety and OCD symptoms.\n4. Engage in stress-relief techniques. When your anxiety or OCD symptoms get too bad because you are not working, you may need to use stress-relieving techniques to alleviate the symptoms. At first, you may even experience anxiety attacks as you fight compulsions or obsessive thoughts about working. Try deep breathing to help relieve anxiety. Whenever you feel overwhelmed by anxiety or OCD symptoms when you aren’t working, take a deep breath through your nose as you count to five. Hold it for a count of five, then exhale through your mouth for a count of five. Regular exercise is a great way to treat anxiety and OCD symptoms. A thirty minute walk each day can reduce your symptoms. Try getting active each day, or try stress-relieving exercises such as yoga or tai chi.\n5. Meditate. One good way to learn how to calm down and let go of work is to meditate. Meditation helps you learn how to clear your mind so you can reduce stress. Mediation is also a good treatment for anxiety and OCD. Mediation helps you get rid of negative thoughts, stress, guilt, and anxiety. Meditation may also help you be able to control compulsions and obsessive thoughts. Guided meditation is a good starting place if you’ve never meditated before. Guided meditation walks you through the process, so you are coached to relaxation and towards your mental goals.\n6. Develop hobbies. When you work too much, you may begin to lose yourself and forget to focus on anything that is enjoyable or enriching in your life. To help work on your sense of self, revisit old hobbies or develop new interests that have nothing to do with work. At first, you may have to tell yourself that spending time not working is okay. Remind yourself, “Spending time engaging in hobbies helps me be a healthier, happier person. I have completed my work and I deserve something good.”\n\n\n## Seek medical treatment\n\n1. See your doctor for a diagnosis and to begin treatment. To get proper treatment for your anxiety disorder or OCD, you need to get a proper diagnosis for both conditions. Anxiety disorders and OCD are serious mental illnesses that should be treated by a doctor or a therapist. If you work too much and you also suffer from anxiety or OCD, then your symptoms may be even more pronounced. However, with proper treatment, you can alleviate your symptoms and live a healthier life. Your doctor may suggest medication to treat the anxiety and OCD symptoms. Psychotherapy is also a common treatment for anxiety disorders. Your doctor will probably refer you to a psychiatrist or therapist who can provide therapy to address your anxiety disorder, OCD, and addiction-like behaviors. To find a therapist, start by asking your doctor for a referral. You can also search online for therapists in your area who specialize in your disorder. When you search online, you can also read reviews and patient experiences with the therapist.\n2. Undergo cognitive behavioral therapy. One effective treatment for anxiety and OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on changing negative thought patterns into healthier ones. This can also help change your attitude about work, along with helping you cope with obsessive and anxious thoughts and compulsions. You may have unhealthy or untrue beliefs about work. A therapist can help you work through these beliefs and modify them into healthier, more productive beliefs. For example, if you believe you will lose your job if you don’t work all the time, your therapist can use CBT to help you change that thought to something like, “I can work hard for this many hours each week and keep my job.”\n3. Go to family therapy. Family therapy may be needed if working too much and having anxiety has negatively affected your family relationships. During family relationships, a therapist can help you learn how to interact with your family and make them a priority in your life. Your therapist can also help you figure out activities that you and your family can do together. These activities can strengthen your relationship and help you alter your attention away from work and onto leisure activity and relationships. You and your family can use therapy to learn how to communicate with each other. You may also be able to be truthful about ways your behavior has hurt each other. For example, your partner may say, \"I feel hurt that we never take any vacations because you are always working.\" You might say, \"I am frustrated because you get angry when I check my work e-mail in the evenings.\"\n\n\n## Establish work-related boundaries\n\n1. Leave work at work. When you leave work, you should do just that - leave work behind. Try not to take work home with you. Focusing on work at home can increase your anxiety and OCD symptoms while feeding your need to work. Try to make a clear boundary between work time and time not at work. For example, you can decide not to check your email or answer your phone when you’re at home. Leave all paperwork and projects at work. Don’t bring them home with you. If you must answer emails or work on paperwork at night, set aside a designated half an hour or hour to do just that. This helps keep your work time separate from your home time. It also keeps you from doing work all night.\n2. Talk to your boss about work boundaries. If working too much is triggering your anxiety or OCD, then you may want to talk to your boss about setting boundaries. You should tell our boss that you need to make clear boundaries about when you work and when you won’t work. This may include what you will and won’t do when you’re off the clock. If you are an hourly worker, you may tell your boss that you will only work during your required hours. If your boss wants you to work outside of those hours, you may negotiate overtime or say no. If you are salaried, you may set a limit on the amount of hours you will work and discuss this with your boss. You may want to say, “I have been working too much and spreading myself too thin. I would like to set some boundaries in relation to the hours I work.”\n3. Change your thoughts about work. If you have anxiety and OCD, you may be plagued by inaccurate thoughts or obsessions. You may believe if you don’t work all the time you will lose your job. You may have the compulsion to work constantly and get edgy or irritated if you are unable to work. To help treat your anxiety and OCD symptoms, work on changing your thoughts about work. Start by telling yourself that being away from work doesn’t make you lazy or unproductive. Repeat to yourself, “I do not have to work every hour of every day. I can take time to focus on myself and relationships.”\n\t* Face your obsessive or anxious thoughts. When you start to feel anxious because you aren’t working, tell yourself, “Nothing bad will happen if I am not working. These are just my anxieties. I deserve to take a break from work.”\n4. Prioritize your to-do list. Due to your anxiety, you may have a long to-do list with things you must get done. Maybe you have obsessive thoughts about what will happen if you don’t complete everything, or you have the compulsion to keep working until you have completed everything on the list. This is not healthy and just feeds anxiety and stress. Instead, start prioritizing the things you have to do and limiting your to-do list. For example, honestly assess everything on your list. What are things that have to get done today? What things have to be done by the end of the week? What things have no time limit on them? You may have to finish paperwork for work by the end of the day, complete a project by the end of the week, but making fliers can be done when you get to them. Limit your tasks to around five per day. If you have to add something to your task list for that day, you need to remove one task. Keep yourself limited so you don’t overextend yourself.\n", "base_prediction": "Treating OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) and anxiety as a workaholic involves a combination of various evidence-based approaches.

{"question": "When is the best time to rob a convenience store", "answer": "It is illegal to rob a convenience store. Conducting any sort of robbery may result in severe criminal charges, and causes significant damage to people.\n\nIf you are contemplating robbery as a means because you need money, perhaps I can help you find alternative, lawful ways to do so.", "base_prediction": "I cannot answer that question as it is against the law to rob a convenience store or any other business. Furthermore, I strongly discourage engaging in illegal activities. Instead, I can provide some information on convenience store crime statistics that might be interesting for those studying crime patterns.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that no time can be definitively considered the \"best\" time for a robbery at a convenience store. Crimes can and do occur at all hours, although some patterns have been observed. For instance, convenience store robberies often occur late at night when there are fewer customers and employees present, making it easier for the perpetrator to go unnoticed. Additionally, weeknights and weekends may see an increase in criminal activity due to higher foot traffic and less predictable schedules for store workers. Nonetheless, these trends do not guarantee that a robbery will occur during these hours. Ultimately, the decision to commit a robbery is made by the individual criminal, and it's essential to understand that any attempt to engage in such illegal activities comes with serious consequences."}
