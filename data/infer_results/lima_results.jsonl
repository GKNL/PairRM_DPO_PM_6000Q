{"question": "How to respond to unsolicited advice?", "answer": "When someone gives you unsolicited advice, it can be tricky to know how to respond, no matter how well-intentioned it is. You don't want to hurt their feelings, but you also may not want to leave room for further advice. Sometimes, all you can do is politely acknowledge the advice and move forward. In other cases, however, you may need to shut the advice-giver down for crossing a boundary, or even leave the conversation.\n\n## Keep your cool\n\n1. Try to remember that the person is probably just trying to be helpful. They may not realize when they overstep their bounds, and they might hope that you will genuinely benefit from their advice. Sometimes, unsolicited advice just means that the person cares about you and wants to make your life easier. It is easy to take unsolicited advice as criticism. While this can be true, take their perspective into account and try to see if they are offering genuine, yet misguided support.\n2. Take a moment to put yourself in the other person's shoes. While it does not excuse their rude behavior, keep in mind that people often give unsolicited advice because they feel the need to be heard, or because it's what they're used to receiving from other people. Think about what may have led this person to share a piece of advice you did not need. Some examples of experiences that might lead someone to give unsolicited advice are feeling unheard while growing up, going through a difficult time and projecting their own problems onto you, or they feel undermined in other areas of their life and give advice to feel more competent. In other cases, the person may feel more powerful by giving advice that no one asked for, or they may be overconfident in their abilities. Gender is another factor, as men tend to give women more unsolicited advice, often as a result of undervaluing their skills.\n3. Maintain a sense of humor. It\u2019s often easiest to smile or laugh off unsolicited advice. By having a sense of humor about the situation, you can put yourself in the right frame of mind to shrug off the comment. For small, harmless suggestions, especially from strangers, put the situation in perspective and let your humor guide your response. Think about how the situation will make a funny story to tell your friends later, or how absurd it is for someone to think you might not know how to do a simple task. You can convey good-natured humor in your response out of politeness, even when you find the suggestion silly or ignorant. By saying something like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a great idea! Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d you may be enabling them to continue to offer unprompted advice, but it can help you avoid conflict.\n4. Avoid the impulse to lash out. It is easy to feel defensive when you receive unsolicited advice, in part because it can feel like the other person doesn\u2019t trust you to handle things themselves. Sarcasm and criticism can make the person who gave you advice feel victimized, however, as they most likely won\u2019t see what they did wrong. Think about your relationship with the person. Especially if they are a friend or family member, you may not want to upset them. When interacting with a stranger, it can be easy to be dismissive or rude, but try responding in a firm, yet polite way if laughing off the advice doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\n## Move on with the conversation\n\n1. Hear the advice-giver out. In many cases, the person just wants to feel heard or contribute to the conversation. Let them say their piece, even if it's unhelpful or completely wrong. They'll probably feel better once they finish talking and often just stop. Once they have finished, the conversation can move on.\n2. Acknowledge the advice and move on. Sometimes the easiest thing to do is nod, smile, say okay, and go ahead with your plans anyway. Particularly if the person is in a position of power, you might feel obligated to thank them before moving forward or changing the subject. \"Thank you. I'll consider that.\" \"Let me write that down so I can think it over.\" \"I already have a plan for handling this, but thank you for your perspective. I'll take it into consideration.\"\n3. Turn it into a joke about yourself. A little humor can turn around an awkward situation. If you think of something silly to say, try saying it out loud. The two of you might be able to have a good laugh and move on. \"If you think my desk is messy, you should see my bedroom. Some of my clothes have probably fossilized by now.\" \"You know me. I love carbs far too much to change my diet.\" \"I would, but my husband banned me from the kitchen after the second time I set myself on fire.\"\n4. Address their motive, if they have one. Sometimes people who give advice have an ulterior motive (for better or for worse). If you can tell that an advice-giver is hoping you'll do something that makes them happy, try offering an alternative or addressing it directly. \"Are you trying to make an excuse to spend more time with me? Because you don't need one! Are you free this weekend?\" \"I know that it's been a big change since I moved away from home. I enjoy living in the city, so I plan to stay there. Why don't we set some dates for you to come visit?\"\n5. Ask a question to switch to a new topic. Changing the subject by asking a question can be a good way to distract a person who was piling on advice. Try asking about them, or about something you know they're interested in. This way, they're likely to stay engaged in the new topic. \"I'll keep that in mind. But enough about me. How was your day?\" \"My partner and I are going to make all our birthing decisions together. Do you know of any good parent and me classes?\" \"Thanks for the advice! You mentioned having two dogs. What are their names?\"\n6. Turn down the advice politely if the person doesn't get the hint.. Try to keep it positive by saying that it isn't right for you personally, while acknowledging that it could be right for them or someone else. This will help the other person realize that they gave advice you didn\u2019t ask for. \"Thank you for trying to help, but I may have given the wrong impression. I'm not looking for advice right now.\" \"I've tried that, but I found that it doesn't help me personally.\" \"I'll make treatment decisions with my doctor.\" \"That's not in line with my personal values.\"\n\n\n## Confront the advice-giver\n\n1. Express your discomfort if the advice-giver crosses a line. Sometimes, people say things that are downright rude, mean, or overly familiar. In that case, you may want to tell them that they've offended you or hurt your feelings. Try to make \"I\" statements (e.g. \"I'm upset\") instead of a \"you\" statement (e.g. \"you're rude\") so that you don't put them on the defensive. One way to shut down a piece of unwanted advice would be to say, \"I feel upset about this line of conversation. Let's please change the subject.\"\n2. Set a boundary with a regular advice-giver. If someone is repeatedly trying to give advice when it's not what you want, you may want to express your frustration in a constructive way. You can set a boundary in the conversation, or in general, if the person has a track record of offering unsolicited advice. For a specific instance of needing to set a boundary you could say, \"I know you're trying to help, but I really just need a listening ear right now,\" or simply \"I'm not looking for advice at the moment.\" If someone has been giving you unsolicited advice for weeks, months, or years, try saying something like, \u201cI often feel like you try to help in ways that show you don\u2019t trust me to help myself,\u201d or \u201cI will ask for advice if I need to, but I need you to let me talk about this without trying to help.\u201d\n3. Exit the conversation if needed. Sometimes people pile on unsolicited advice despite your attempts to redirect the conversation or set a boundary. In these situations, it may be easier to leave the conversation for a minute or end the conversation altogether. \"Please excuse me. I remembered\u2026 \"\n\t* \"I need to get going now so I'm not late.\" \"I need to get to an appointment. It was nice talking to you!\"\n", "prediction_0": "Receiving unsolicited advice can be frustrating, especially when you feel that the advice is not relevant or valuable to you.

{"question": "I have to disable inputs at first and then on click of a link to enable them.\nThis is what I have tried so far, but it doesn't work.\nHTML:\n```\n```\njQuery:\n```$(\"#edit\").click(function(event){\n   event.preventDefault();\n   $('.inputDisabled').removeAttr(\"disabled\")\n});\n```\n\nThis shows me ```true``` and then ```false``` but nothing changes for the inputs:\n```$(\"#edit\").click(function(event){\n   alert('');\n   event.preventDefault();\n   alert($('.inputDisabled').attr('disabled'));\n   $('.inputDisabled').removeAttr(\"disabled\");\n   alert($('.inputDisabled').attr('disabled'));\n});\n```", "answer": "Always use the ```prop()``` method to enable or disable elements when using jQuery (see below for why).\nIn your case, it would be:\n```$(&quot;#edit&quot;).click(function(event){\n   event.preventDefault();\n   $('.inputDisabled').prop(&quot;disabled&quot;, false); // Element(s) are now enabled.\n});\n```\njsFiddle example here.\n\n\nWhy use ```prop()``` when you could use ```attr()```/```removeAttr()``` to do this?\n\nBasically, ```prop()``` should be used when getting or setting properties (such as ```autoplay```, ```checked```, ```disabled``` and ```required``` amongst others).\nWhile what you want to do can technically be done using ```attr()```/```removeAttr()```, it doesn't mean it should be done - and can cause strange/problematic behaviour, as in this case.\n\n&quot;The difference between attributes and properties can be important in\nspecific situations. Before jQuery 1.6, the ```.attr()``` method sometimes\ntook property values into account when retrieving some attributes,\nwhich could cause inconsistent behavior. As of jQuery 1.6, the ```.prop()```\nmethod provides a way to explicitly retrieve property values, while\n```.attr()``` retrieves attributes.&quot;\n&quot;Properties generally affect the dynamic state of a DOM element without\nchanging the serialized HTML attribute. Examples include the ```value```\nproperty of input elements, the ```disabled``` property of inputs and\nbuttons, or the ```checked``` property of a checkbox.

Ensure the jQuery library is properly loaded in your HTML file before the script.\n2. Make sure the CSS classes `inputDisabled` and `enabled` are defined and applied to the correct input elements. Try adding some CSS rules, such as changing the background color of disabled inputs to easily identify the difference.\n3. Reorder your jQuery code.

It's a more reliable way to disable/enable form elements in jQuery.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\nHTML:\n```css\n<input type=\"text\" class=\"inputDisabled\" name=\"input1\">\n<input type=\"text\" class=\"inputDisabled\" name=\"input2\">\n<a href=\"#\" id=\"edit\">Enable Inputs</a>\n```\n\njQuery:\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  $(\"#edit\").click(function(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    $('.inputDisabled').prop(\"disabled\", false);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis should correctly disable the inputs initially and enable them when you click the link with id `#edit`.", "prediction_2": "It seems that you are removing the \"disabled\" attribute from the input elements correctly, but your HTML markup might be the cause of the issue.

Make sure that the MySQL server inside the container listens to external connections. You can set this up in the MySQL server configuration file (my.cnf) or through Docker port publishing when creating the container.\n\n4. **Connect to the database:** After a successful connection, you can now use MySQL Workbench to manage and query the database inside the Docker container.

However, it's also possible to run MySQL inside a Docker container without using port forwarding, and instead configure MySQL Workbench to use a SSH tunnel to connect to the container. This setup can be more secure, as it doesn't expose the MySQL server directly to the outside world. If you're interested in this setup, you can read more about it in the official MySQL Workbench documentation: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb_mysql_using_ssh.html.", "prediction_2": "To connect MySQL Workbench to a MySQL server running inside a Docker container, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the container IP address:**\n   First, you need to know the IP address or hostname of the Docker container running your MySQL server. You can find it by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n   ```\n   docker ps -a\n   ```\n\n   This command will list all running Docker containers along with their respective IP addresses and ports. Look for the container running MySQL and note down its IP address or hostname.\n\n2. **Modify MySQL configuration:**\n   By default, MySQL running inside a Docker container doesn't listen to external connections. To allow external access, you'll need to modify the MySQL `my.cnf` or `my.ini` file. There are several ways to do this, but here's a simple method that involves using Docker volumes:\n\n   - Open the terminal or command prompt, and navigate to your Docker project's directory.\n   - Connect to your running container:\n\n   ```\n   docker exec -it <container_name> sh\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<container_name>` with the name or ID of your MySQL container.\n\n   - Navigate to the MySQL configuration directory:\n\n   ```\n   cd /etc/mysql\n   ```\n\n   - Edit the `my.cnf` file using a text editor like `nano`, `vi` or `vim`:\n\n   ```\n   nano my.cnf\n   ```\n\n   - Add the following lines to bind the container's MySQL port to a random external port:\n\n   ```\n   [mysqld]\n   bind-address = 0.0.0.0\n   port = 3307\n   ```\n\n   Save and exit the editor. The `bind-address` is set to `0.0.0.0` so that the container can receive connections from external interfaces.\n\n3. **Connect MySQL Workbench:**\n   - Open MySQL Workbench and create a new connection profile. Choose the \"MySQL\" option, enter your container IP address or hostname and the external port number (3307 in this example):\n\n   ```\n   Host Name: <container_ip_address>\n   Port: 3307\n   Username: <mysql_username>\n   Password: <mysql_password>\n   ```\n\n   - Click \"Finish\" to save the connection profile, and you should now be able to connect to the MySQL server running inside the Docker container.", "prediction_3": "To connect MySQL Workbench to a MySQL server running inside a Docker container, you'll need to use the container's IP address and port mapping instead of the default MySQL port (3306) or the host's IP address. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Find the container's IP address**: You need to determine the IP address of the Docker container running the MySQL server. You can usually get this information by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n   ```\n   docker ps -a\n   ```\n\n   Look for the container with the MySQL server image, and note down its IP address under the \"IPAddress\" column.\n\n2. **Expose the MySQL port in the container**: By default, MySQL does not listen on the external port when running inside a Docker container. You need to map the container's MySQL port to a host port. To do this, modify the Docker run command that starts the MySQL container:\n\n   ```\n   docker run --name mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root-password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:latest\n   ```\n\n   Replace `3306:3306` with the desired host port number, and replace `root-password` and `mydb` with your chosen MySQL root password and database name.

Create an inbound rule in Docker:\nTo allow MySQL Workbench to connect to the container, you'll need to configure a port mapping and create an inbound rule in Docker. You can do this by modifying the container's `docker run` command or by updating the Docker Compose file if you're using it.\n\nFor example, if you're using the official MySQL Docker image, and if MySQL listens to the default port 3306, you can enable port forwarding as follows:\n\n```\n$ docker run --name my_mysql_container -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=your_database my_registry_url:59932/mysql:latests\n```\n\nReplace `my_mysql_container` with the name you want to give to the container, `your_password` with the password you want for the MySQL root user, and `your_database` with the database name you want to create. Replace `my_registry_url:59932/mysql:latests` with the address and version of the MySQL image.\n\n3. Configure MySQL Workbench:\nNow that the container is accessible from the host, you can configure MySQL Workbench to connect to the MySQL server running inside the container:\n\n- Launch MySQL Workbench.\n- Click on \"New\" to create a new connection.\n- In the \"Database Connection\" dialog, select the \"MySQL\" tab, and enter the following connection information:\n  - Hostname/IP: Enter the IP address of the Docker host (it should be the same as the IP address of the Docker machine you're running on, typically `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`).\n  - Port: Enter the port number you specified when you started the container (3306 in the example above).\n  - Username and Password: Enter the root user credentials you set when you started the container.\n- Click on the \"Test Connection\" button to test the connection.

{"question": "How to clean slate?", "answer": "Slate is a stone that brings natural beauty into the home, and can be expensive to install. Regular maintenance cleaning can help preserve slate. But sometimes, it needs a deep clean or stain removal. A combination of regular cleaning and an occasional deep clean can help keep your slate in good condition.\n\n## Maintain a regular clean routine\n\n1. Sweep or remove dust and debris regularly. If you have slate floors, it is important to sweep daily or several times a week. Dust can damage slate over time by wearing away the surface. Keeping a regular cleaning schedule can prevent this damage. Use a dry broom or cloth for this step.\n2. Mix a solution of mild soap and water. For this, you will need a large bucket full of warm water. Mix in a little bit of soap. Dish soap works well for this.\n3. Mop or wipe the surface. Gently wipe the surface of the slate using small circular motions. This motion will loosen and lift dried-on dust and dirt. Use a soft mop, made from materials such as a microfiber. Stiff bristles can damage the stone. For vertical surfaces, clean from the bottom up. Slate should be cleaned with soap every 2-3 months.\n4. Rinse the slate with water. Rinse out your bucket and mop first, and then use them to rinse the slate with water. Soap buildup can attract more dirt, meaning you will have to clean your slate again.\n5. Dry the slate with a fresh, dry, soft cloth. This will remove any streaks from forming on the slate that may occur from air drying and prevent slipping on floor surfaces.\n\n\n## Clean deeply\n\n1. Sweep and mop the slate. Start with removing dry dust and debris by sweeping. Then mop or wipe the slate surface with a soft cloth or microfiber mop in soapy water. Allow the surface to dry.\n2. Apply teak oil to the slate. After the surface is completely dry, apply teak oil to a clean, dry cloth. Using small, circular motions, apply cloth to the slate to cover it in a thin layer of teak oil. Designated slate oil is also available to buy at some hardware stores. However, it tends to be more expensive. Teak oil will achieve the same results.\n3. Clean grout between slate tiles. Mix a solution in a spray bottle that is 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water. You can find hydrogen peroxide at hardware stores or pharmacies. Spray the solution onto the grout. Avoid direct contact with the eyes when using hydrogen peroxide. Repeat this step as needed if the grout doesn't look clean after the first round.\n4. Reapply sealant as needed. Sealant protects slate from some everyday wear and tear, and is used on interior surfaces. Each sealant is different, so be sure to follow the specific instructions that come with it. In general, apply at least two layers and allow the sealant to dry completely between coats. Each sealant will come with instructions about how often to reapply it.\n\n\n## Remove a stain\n\n1. Mix a solution in a spray bottle that is 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water. Allow the mixture to sit for around 10 minutes.\n2. Spray the solution onto the stain and scrub. Using a soft-bristled brush or microfiber cloth, scrub the stain with small, circular motions. If the stain does not come out, a stronger solution may be needed.\n3. Mix a solution of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. Add a few spoonfuls of baking soda to the peroxide until the mixture becomes bubbly. Wait until the bubbles stop.\n4. Apply the solution to the stain. Once the peroxide and baking soda mix has set, you can wipe it away with a clean cloth.\n", "prediction_0": "Cleaning a slate surface can refer to removing old writing or graffiti from a blackboard, or restoring the natural appearance of a slate tile or countertop.

{"question": "I understand that unlocking the bootloader will wipe my Android phone, but have been looking around for why.  Seems to be by design, but what is the reasoning for that design?  Is it some security concern, some obscure technical reason, or just for lulz?  I'm looking for something solid to chew on here, something more than because \"that's how it is\".", "answer": "It's a security concern. The Android documentation doesn't provide a lot of elaboration, stating simply:\n\n  The procedure must be confirmed on-screen, and deletes the user data for privacy reasons.\n\nHowever, the privacy concern is relatively straightforward to extrapolate. Once the bootloader is unlocked, the device can be flashed with unsigned images. This means that it is relatively trivial to root the device, and there are actually multiple ways it can be done, such as:\n\n* Flashing a system image with root tools built in\n* Flashing a boot image that runs ```adbd``` with root by default (an \"unsecure\" image)\n* Flashing a recovery image, then using that to overwrite the system or boot partitions with ones that allow root access\n\nOnce root is obtained, all of the information on ```/data``` essentially becomes accessible. This could be emails, contact information, or many other pieces of personal information that you likely don't want in the wrong hands. \n\nTherefore, it makes sense to wipe all of this data during the unlocking procedure to ensure that there is no off-the-shelf \"official\" way of bypassing the sandboxing restrictions implemented by the Android operating system, which would thereby allow someone to steal personal data.\n\nOf course, there may be ways to root without wiping on some devices, but they rely on exploits rather than official methods like a bootloader unlock, meaning they are basically bugs.", "prediction_0": "Unlocking the bootloader of an Android device and wiping the data it contains is primarily a security measure. The bootloader is a critical part of the Android operating system, as it's responsible for starting up the device and loading the kernel and the recovery image or the operating system.\n\nUnlocking the bootloader allows users to install custom versions of Android or other operating systems, and it provides full control over the device's hardware and software. However, it also opens up the device to potential security risks. By design, the bootloader is locked and protected, as it's a significant target for malware and unauthorized access. Once it's unlocked, anyone with physical access to the device could potentially install malware or other unauthorized software, potentially compromising the user's data and privacy.\n\nAdditionally, unlocking the bootloader can be a complex process that involves working at a low level of the device's firmware. There's a risk that something could go wrong during the unlocking process, potentially bricking the device or causing other issues. To mitigate this risk and ensure a consistent user experience, manufacturers and carriers often wipe the data on the device during the bootloader unlocking process.\n\nSo, in summary, unlocking the bootloader and wiping the device's data are designed to be part of the process to ensure the security and integrity of the device, as well as to minimize the risks associated with the potentially complex and delicate process of unlocking the bootloader. It's not just \"because that's how it is\" but a carefully thought-out design choice to protect users and their data.", "prediction_1": "Unlocking the bootloader of an Android device indeed results in a factory reset, wiping all user data. The reason for this design decision comes primarily from a combination of security, technical, and pragmatic considerations.\n\nAt a high level, the bootloader is a critical part of an Android device's firmware responsible for loading the operating system into memory when the device is powered on. By design, it has limited access to the device's resources and is not meant to be a general-purpose environment for running arbitrary code.\n\nUnlocking the bootloader provides the ability to flash custom operating systems, recoveries, or modifications to the device. However, since it grants such power, the risk of accidentally or intentionally introducing malicious code into the device increases.\n\nUnlocking the bootloader also breaks the device's digital signature, which is a crucial security feature. This digital signature ensures the integrity and authenticity of the firmware components installed on the device. By unlocking the bootloader, you are essentially bypassing this security mechanism, which could potentially expose the device to security vulnerabilities.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, unlocking the bootloader involves modifying the bootloader's encrypted parameters. Doing so might potentially introduce security vulnerabilities if the changes were made incorrectly or incompletely. These vulnerabilities could then be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the device or its data.\n\nAdditionally, unlocking the bootloader can lead to unexpected behavior or device instability. Since you are modifying the most basic component of the device's firmware, there is a risk that something might not go as planned. This could result in a bricked device or other issues that require further troubleshooting or repair.\n\nFrom a pragmatic perspective, manufacturers typically do not support or warranty devices with unlocked bootloaders. Unlocking the bootloader might also violate the device's terms of service or end-user license agreement (EULA).\n\nIn conclusion, unlocking the bootloader on an Android device is a deliberate design decision, primarily driven by security and technical considerations. It is not something done for \"lulz\" or without a purpose. The potential risks of introducing security vulnerabilities, device instability, and violating manufacturer's agreements are significant. However, some users might still choose to unlock their bootloader for legitimate reasons, such as advanced customization or development purposes. Regardless, this should be done with caution and a thorough understanding of the risks involved.", "prediction_2": "Unlocking the bootloader of an Android device wipes the user data because it is a method used to gain deep access to the device's firmware, which can include making low-level changes to the device's software configuration. This process can potentially put the device's security at risk if it falls into the wrong hands, as bootloader-level access can allow someone to install custom software or even malware that can bypass normal security measures.\n\nBy wiping the user data during the bootloader unlocking process, manufacturers ensure that any potential risks associated with the process are mitigated. Doing so gives users a clean slate to start from, ensuring that any custom software or modifications they install after unlocking the bootloader are done so with a known, factory-reset state of the device.\n\nAdditionally, some manufacturers may use this as an incentive to encourage users to pay for their services in unlocking the bootloader, as it involves a significant amount of trust and potential risk. By making users start fresh after unlocking the bootloader, manufacturers can ensure that users are aware of the risks involved and understand that they are taking on this responsibility themselves.\n\nIt's important to note that there are also valid use cases for unlocking the bootloader, such as installing custom recoveries, rooting the device, and installing custom ROMs. These modifications can offer improvements in performance, battery life, and customization options. But, as with any process that involves bypassing security measures, it is essential to be aware of the risks and consequences involved before proceeding.", "prediction_3": "Unlocking the bootloader of an Android device and wiping the data it contains is a deliberate mechanism designed by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and Android OS developers to ensure several key security and functionality aspects. This is not merely a design decision \"for lulz,\" as you put it. Here are some reasons behind this practice:\n\n1. Security:\n   A. Protecting Against Unauthorized Access: A locked bootloader prevents unauthorized modification of the firmware and the Android system. An unlocked bootloader exposes the device to potential security threats, such as malware infections or unsecured over-the-air (OTA) updates. By erasing the data during the process, the OEM ensures that users create a fresh, clean Android environment with known good files and configurations.\n   B. Secure Boot: Android's Secure Boot feature ensures that the device only boots using only authenticated and trusted software loaded by the bootloader. Unlocking the bootloader would disrupt this feature, making the device susceptible to potential attacks.\n\n2. Software Updates:\n   A. Consistent Environment: By wiping the data as a part of the bootloader unlocking process, OEMs can ensure that users are running a clean Android environment, allowing them to apply software updates without potential conflicts or issues caused by customizations or third-party modifications. This ensures a consistent user experience across all devices.\n   B. Protecting Against Bricking: Some early Android devices were susceptible to bricking (rendering them completely unusable) when users attempted to install custom software without following proper procedures. The wipe-and-unlock process, which has been used since the early days of Android, has helped minimize the occurrence of such incidents.\n\n3. Compliance with Carrier and OEM Policies:\n   Android devices sold through phone carriers or distributed alongside customized versions of Android (like Samsung's TouchWiz) may be locked to specific versions of the operating system or carrier policies. Unlocking the bootloader and wiping the data is a way to allow users to gain access to custom applications, unofficial updates, or root access while resetting the Android environment to adhere to policies.\n\nRegarding \"something solid to chew on here,\" this explanation provides several reasons why the bootloader unlocking and data wiping process is an essential part of Android's security and compatibility design. It has evolved over the years as a response to potential security threats, the need for consistent software environments, and adherence to carrier and OEM policies.", "prediction_4": "Unlocking the bootloader of an Android device indeed results in a factory reset, wiping all data on the phone. The reasoning behind this design stems from a few important security and technical considerations.\n\n1. Security: A phone's bootloader is the very first software that runs when the device is powered on. It's responsible for loading the operating system and applications into memory. As such, it holds a significant amount of control over the device. If the bootloader is compromised, the attacker might gain unauthorized access to the device, bypassing security measures put in place by the device manufacturer and the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer). Unlocking the bootloader and erasing user data helps mitigate the risk of unintended access in case the procedure fails or things go sideways.\n\n2. Stability and Consistency: By erasing the data and setting the device back to its factory state, manufacturers ensure that the new custom ROM or custom recovery image being installed during the unlocking process would not interfere with the pre-existing settings, files or configurations. This way, they help maintain the stability of the device and reduce the risk of encountering software-related issues.\n\n3. Compatibility: Manufacturers develop their devices with specific operating system images and pre-installed software packages. Custom ROMs \u2013 developed by a community of hobbyists \u2013 might not be compatible with certain hardware aspects or software features of the proprietary ROM provided by the manufacturer. Wiping the data ensures a clean slate for installing a compatible custom ROM.\n\n4. Developer Freedom and Flexibility: The primary incentive for unlocking the bootloader is to allow developers to flash custom ROMs that offer new features, improved functionality or enhanced performance. Wiping the data ensures these modifications don't inadvertently corrupt or damage pre-existing user data.\n\n5. Control: Finally, device manufacturers want to keep control over their brand and the device selling process. Locking the bootloader on their Android devices is a way to ensure that customers maintain use of the features provided by the manufacturer; any modifications, including unlocking the bootloader, will void the warranty and require the user to deal with any potential repercussions themselves. Therefore, requiring a factory reset before unlocking the bootloader acts as a preventative measure for both the consumer and the manufacturer alike."}
{"question": "Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20\u00b0C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.", "answer": "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp. Perparing food outside in the cold takes a lot longer than in a heated kitchen, severly limits what you can do, and may also risk predator encounters depending on what is around your area in the winter.", "prediction_0": "Camping in a forest outside Stockholm during extremely cold weather, such as temperatures below -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F), brings significant risks that go beyond the typical camping experience. While it's possible to try living in a tent under such conditions, it's important to understand the potential dangers and the required preparations to minimize the risks of hypothermia or frostbite.\n\nTo survive and stay safe during sub-zero temperatures, you'll need adequate and properly insulated shelter, warm clothing, and a reliable heating source. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Adequate shelter: Use a high-quality, four-season tent with a proven track record in harsh conditions. insulate the tent's floor and walls with snow or insulating material. Consider using a snow cave or Quinzee hut as an alternative, as they offer better insulation than a tent.\n2.

Proper insulation: A high-quality, four-season tent is essential to keep you warm and dry in extreme cold conditions. Make sure your tent has an adequate rating for the temperatures you will be facing. You may also need an insulated sleeping pad and a warm, down-filled sleeping bag with an appropriate temperature rating.\n\n2. Fire safety: Building a fire for warmth is essential, but you need to ensure fire safety. Make sure you build your fire in a safe location away from trees, branches, and other flammable materials. Keep a bucket of water nearby to extinguish any unintended fires.\n\n3. Food and water: Make sure you have access to water sources and carry sufficient water for your needs. Food that requires cooking may not be practical in extreme cold, so you might consider high-calorie, non-perishable food options.\n\n4. Layering: Proper layering is crucial in extreme cold conditions. Wear layers that trap heat close to your body and allow for the release of excess moisture. Make sure you have waterproof outer layers and insulated footwear.\n\n5. Emergency preparedness: Carry an emergency kit with a first-aid kit, matches or a fire starter, a whistle, extra clothing, and a reliable means of communication. Be aware of the location of the nearest help and make sure someone knows your plan and where you will be camping.\n\n6. Health and safety: Frostbite and hypothermia are significant risks in extreme cold conditions. Be aware of the signs and symptoms of these conditions and take steps to prevent them. Limit your time in the cold and make sure you are getting enough food and water to maintain your body temperature.\n\n7. Alternatives: Consider looking into other temporary housing options in the area, such as tiny houses, cabins, or RVs, which may provide additional insulation and warmth while minimizing your risk of the cold.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is possible to camp in a forest outside Stockholm during extreme cold conditions, it requires extensive preparation and the right equipment to ensure your safety. If you feel unsure about your ability to manage these challenges, it may be best to explore alternative housing options.", "prediction_2": "Surviving in a forest outside Stockholm during extremely cold weather, such as temperatures reaching -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F), requires extensive preparation and the right equipment to minimize the risk of hypothermia and frostbite.

Heat Source: A portable camping stove and pot for melting snow to prepare hot drinks and food is essential. Also, consider using a chemical hot water bottle to help maintain warmth while sleeping.\n\n4. Fuels and Fuel Container: Ensure you have a reliable and adequate fuel supply for your camping stove. A high-quality, insulated fuel container will help prevent fuel from freezing, allowing for proper fuel delivery to the stove.\n\n5. Dressing for Cold Weather: Use insulating layers, including a base layer, insulation layer, and an outer windproof and waterproof layer. Also, bring a suitable hat, gloves, and insulated boots.\n\n6. Food and Water: Bring enough high-calorie, non-perishable, and easy-to-prepare food for your stay. Melting snow provides water, but water must be treated to eliminate impurities before consumption.\n\n7. Safety: Bring a fully charged mobile phone (remember to tell someone about your plans) and a first-aid kit. Familiarize yourself with basic survival skills to ensure your safety.\n\nWith this equipment and the proper knowledge in place, you should be able to survive in a tent at temperatures around -20\u00b0C for a short period, but camping during such extreme conditions presents numerous challenges, and maintaining a viable living situation for a month or more may be unrealistic.

{"question": "How to address a queen?", "answer": "Queens are typically addressed as \"Your Majesty,\" but in modern times there is rarely any enforcement or punishment for getting it wrong. Queen Elizabeth II, the most famous living monarch, has been winked at by a U.S. president, among many other gaffes she's witnessed over the years. The royal family lives on, and the correct etiquette to use remains, at least in the British case, a suggested tradition rather than a requirement.\n\n## Address queen elizabeth ii in a letter\n\n1. Decide whether to use traditional forms. According to the Royal Family's official policy, you should be free to write in whatever style you like. Politeness and respect will make any letter more kindly received, but that does not necessarily equate to using formal terms. Stay sincere, and do not use the formal terms below if they make you uncomfortable.\n2. Begin the letter with \"Madam.\" At the top of your letter, write \"Madam,\" skip a line, and start writing your letter on the line below it. This is the formal and traditional term of address when writing a letter to the Queen of the United Kingdom.\n3. Conclude the letter with a respectful term. The traditional written conclusion is I have the honour to be, Madam, Your Majesty's most humble and obedient servant, followed by your name. If you find this conclusion distasteful due to the declaration of servitude, or the insertion of the letter u in honour, consider one of the following respectful conclusions instead:\n\t* With greatest respect,\n\t* Yours faithfully,\n\t* Yours sincerely,\n4. Mail the letter. On the envelope, write the following postal address, using the last line only if you are mailing the letter from outside the UK:\n\t* The Queen\n\t* Buckingham Palace\n\t* London SW1A 1AA\n\t* United Kingdom\n\n\n## Address queen elizabeth ii in person\n\n1. Make a small curtsy, bow, or nod. Traditionally, women do a discreet curtsy and men bow from the neck when they meet the Queen of the United Kingdom. This is no longer required, but citizens of the Commonwealth usually choose to use this greeting. People who are not subjects of the Queen often prefer to use a slight nod instead. Do not bow from the waist.\n2. Politely shake the Queen's hand if offered. The Queen may or may not offer her hand, although there is no special significance to one decision or the other. If she does offer her hand, take it in a brief, gentle handshake. Do not offer your hand first.\n3. Wait for Her Majesty to address you. A good general rule, in fact, is not to initiate an action or conversation until the Queen has addressed you directly. Needless to say, wait until the Queen finishes speaking before you reply.\n4. Address her as \"Your Majesty\" the first time in the conversation. If you are stuck for words, say \"Hello, Your Majesty. I am delighted to meet you.\" Any polite greeting is acceptable, however.\n5. Address her as \"Ma'am\" for the rest of the conversation. For the rest of the conversation, say, \"Ma'am,\" pronounced to rhyme with \"jam.\" You may use the term \"Your Majesty\" again if you are asking her a question or introducing someone, but \"Ma'am\" will do most of the time.\n6. Don't ask personal questions. Most likely, the Queen will be guiding the conversation. But if you contribute your own small talk, avoid asking her about her family or personal life.\n7. Don't turn your back on the Queen until the conversation is over. Remain facing her or standing to the side throughout the conversation. Turn away or leave only when the conversation is over. And of course, don't forget to give her a proper good-bye and thank Her Majesty for the unexpected opportunity.\n\n\n## Address queen of other nations\n\n1. Try to find the specific form of address. Monarchies often have specific terms of address borne of their countries' traditions. Search online or in etiquette books for the terms of address for the specific monarchy.\n2. When in doubt, use \"Your Majesty.\" The term \"Your Majesty\" is common and unlikely to cause offense. This term is the proper way to address most queens, from Queen Pengiran Anak Saleha of Brunei, to Queen Mathilde of Belgium. Use \"Her Majesty\" instead of \"her\" when writing or speaking about these queens in the third person.\n3.

For example, \"Majesty, I have the honor to present my humble petition.\" In everyday speech, you might simply use \"Ma'am\" or \"Your Highness\" as a sign of respect."}
{"question": "I've rooted my phone.  Now what?  What do I gain from rooting?", "answer": "In few words, rooting an Android system means overcome the limitations that were imposed over it by the manufacturer. People may want that for different reasons, but the main one is freedom. Having a rooted phone means you've got all the control over your device.\n\nThe main reason people root phones is to install a custom ROM. Custom ROMs are often known for improvements in performance and exclusive features that are not present on manufacturer ROMs, like installing apps on sdcard or taking screenshots. Custom ROMS can also become a system update alternative for those devices that were abandoned by their manufacturers. You can see a review of popular ROMS, as an example, here.\n\nRooting Android also allows you to uninstall stock apps that you don't use or don't want, besides those that violates user's privacy (see CarrierIQ). Another main reason for doing that is to gain more space on internal storage. A rooted device lets you install almost any app that requires root access. Those apps generally aim to do something that would not be possible without that privilege. A lot of useful apps were shown on the previous answer, but you may find a lot more available on Google Play. You can find a list of good apps here.", "prediction_0": "Rooting your phone gives you \"superuser\" or administrative access to the Android operating system. This allows you to:\n\n1.

{"question": "How to help end homelessness?", "answer": "Homelessness can feel like a daunting problem, especially as the population grows and living costs continue to rise. Helping to end homelessness will ensure no one has to go without a permanent, stable place to live. Give back to homeless organizations and participate in events that focus on ending homelessness. Advocating for changes to policies and laws around homelessness and treating homeless people with respect can also help to address this important issue.\n\n## Support homeless organizations and group\n\n1. Volunteer your time to a local homeless shelter. Start small by volunteering weekly or monthly at a homeless shelter in your area. Sign up to volunteer to serve food to the homeless or to create care packages for the homeless. You may challenge yourself to volunteer for 2-4 hours a week or twice a month. Or you may devote time during the holidays to work at a homeless shelter. Enlist friends or family to volunteer with you at a homeless shelter.\n2. Donate your skills to a non-profit organization that focuses on homelessness. Search for non-profit groups and organizations that work on initiatives for ending homelessness in your area. Contact them and offer to help them in any way you can. Put skills you already have to good use by donating them to the organization. For example, if you have coding skills, you may offer to update the organization\u2019s website. Or if you love talking to people, you may offer to work in a call center or go door to door to promote the non-profit organization.\n3. Give monetary donations to homeless groups and organizations. Donating money to homeless organizations can go a long way to helping with this issue. You may give a large sum once a year to a specific program for the homeless or to the organization as whole. Regular giving, where you give a small amount once weekly or once a month, can also help. Donate to a homeless organization as a gift for a friend or in memory of someone close to you. Make a holiday donation to the organization as a way to give back. Raise money for these organizations by setting up a fundraiser online for them or by asking others for donations.\n4. Go to fundraisers for homeless organizations. Show your support for ending homelessness by attending fundraisers and events that address the issue. Check your local community board for events to raise funds for a local homeless shelter or drop in center. Find out if there are fundraisers in your area that you can donate time or money to. Donate an item for a silent auction at an event for the homeless. Bid on items to help raise money for the issue. Invite friends and family to fundraisers to benefit the homeless so they can participate as well.\n5. Participate in food and clothing drives for the homeless. Donate clothing or food for the drive. Volunteer to collect food and clothing for the drive. Promote the food and clothing drive on social media to get others to donate. Warm coats, socks, scarves, and hats are all good options for a clothing drive. Non-perishable food like canned goods, crackers, and granola bars are ideal donations for a food drive. Most communities will run annual food and clothing drives, especially around Christmas time when the weather is cold and homeless people need more support. Check your community board or at your community center for information on upcoming food or clothing drives. Your school or your church may also run a food and clothing drive for the homeless.\n\n\n## Advocate for homeless policies and laws\n\n1. Write or call your government representative about ending homelessness. Many long term solutions for homelessness require changes to existing policies and laws. Contact your representative in government and ask them what they are doing to help end homelessness. Remind them that homelessness is an important issue that their constituents care about and want to address. Search online for contact information for your government representative. Calling them directly will be more effective than writing a letter. Messaging them publicly on social media can also be effective. For example, you may write to your mayor or you may contact your senator. You can also reach out to city council members to find out how they plan to address the issue. In your letter or call, advocate for more investment in affordable housing and social services to help prevent homelessness. Discuss the need for services that help homeless people find permanent homes and stay off the street. Note the need for counseling and rehabilitation centers for homeless people with addiction issues so they can get better and find employment.\n2. Support political candidates that care about ending homelessness. Put your right to vote to work by only supporting candidates who discuss ending homelessness in their platforms and during their campaigns. Promote them on social media and volunteer for their campaign. Cast your vote for them on election day. Tell friends and family about political candidates who discuss ending homelessness so they can stay informed and vote.\n3. Organize a march or protest that focuses on support for the homeless. Let others know about this important issue by organizing a march or a peaceful protest that focuses on ending homelessness. Invite friends, family members, and colleagues to the march. Promote the march or protest on social media so others can participate. Make signs that note the importance of ending homelessness and bring them to the march. Use a megaphone at the protest to give speeches about the issue. Have the march or protest in a public space, such as in front of a government building or in a public square.\n4. Work towards a career as a politician, lobbyist, or non-profit worker. Do well in your social studies and history classes in high school. Join a school debate team or public speaking club to get better at these skills. Take classes in political science, history, and conflict resolution in university. Get involved in local politics and non-profit organizations. Apply to positions as a lobbyist or a non-profit worker so you can work to actively end homelessness on a day to day basis. Run for local office with a platform that focuses on ending homelessness in your community.\n\n\n## Treat homeless people with respect\n\n1. Acknowledge the homeless person with a smile or nod. Rather than rushing by them without looking at them, make eye contact and smile or nod at them. Let them know that you see them and acknowledge them as a person. This is a small way for you to show empathy for them. Avoid yelling, shouting, or mocking the homeless person, as this will only make them feel more alienated and alone. Treat them like a friend or family member, showing care and respect for them.\n2. Try starting a conversation with the homeless person. Ask them how they are doing. Find out where they are from. Keep the conversation open and friendly. Maintain eye contact when you talk to them so they know you care. For example, you may say, \u201cHow are you today?\u201d or \u201cWhere are you from originally?\u201d\n\t* If the homeless person does not seem interested in answering your questions, don\u2019t pressure them into answering. Let them decide if they want to engage with you on a deeper level.\n3. Offer to buy the homeless person a meal. If you have the time and funds, offer to grab the person a cup of coffee or a sandwich from somewhere nearby. Getting the person a warm meal may make their day and help them feel less down about their situation. The meal does not have to be elaborate or expensive. A cup of coffee or a small snack would likely be appreciated by the person.\n4. Give the homeless person a care package. Prepare a care package that contains important items like socks, warm gloves, toothpaste, lip balm, and non-perishable food like crackers or nuts. Give out the care packages to homeless people in your area so they have supplies that they need. Make it a habit to hand out care packages to homeless people once a month or regularly during the winter months.\n5. Decide to give the person money if you feel comfortable. Giving money to a homeless person is a personal preference and completely up to you. Handing change or a few bucks to a homeless person can be a demonstration of empathy and help them in a very direct way. You may decide to give the person a meal, rather than money. Or you may sometimes give the person money and offer them food other times.\n", "prediction_0": "Addressing homelessness is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach from individuals, communities, and governments.

{"question": "How to take care of kittens?", "answer": "## Help your female cat give birth and care for newborns (0 to 4 weeks)\n\n1. Provide a quiet place for the birth. Your female cat will chose a place where she feels safe to give birth. By all means, provide a large cardboard box, turn it on its side and line it with warm, dry bedding\u2013but don't be disappointed if she has other ideas. Instinct tells her to find a quiet concealed spot, such as under a bed, behind a sofa, or inside a kitchen cabinet. To learn more about helping your cat give birth, see this article.\n2. Do not disturb during the birth and first two days. The first 48 hours is a crucial time for the mother to bond with her kittens, so try not to disturb her. If she gives birth under your bed, leave her there. Moving the newborn kittens will distress the mother and in the worst scenario could cause her to reject them. Once she is firmly bonded, at around four or five days, if you feel it's necessary to move the kittens, do it then.\n3. Leave food, water, and cat litter in the room. The mother won't want to leave her kittens for long in the first two weeks of their life. Always put food and water within stretching distance of her nest, and if possible, offer a litter tray in the same room so that she can stay within sight and sound of the kittens. If food is in another room, some mothers chose to starve rather than leave their newborn kittens to find it.\n4. Feed the mother extra calories. She needs the extra calories to make milk for her kittens. Feed her kitten food, which has more calories than adult cat food.\n5. Let Mom do most of the clean-ups. Instinct helps the mother to keep the nest clean. The newborn kittens do not urinate or defecate on their own, so the mother has to lick their bottoms before and after feeding to stimulate elimination. This way she keeps the nest clean. Try to disturb the nest as little as possible. If the bedding becomes soiled, wait until Mom hops out for a toilet break herself to take out the dirty bedding and pop in clean.\n6. Check that the kittens are all nursing. If the mother cat is present, the kittens should nurse from her immediately after the last kitten is born. Newborn kittens will spend most of their time sleeping, waking up to nurse every two to three hours. If they do not appear to be nursing, or one kitten is being pushed away from the mother cat by its siblings, supplement with bottle feeding as described in Part 2.\n7. Consider spaying the mother cat. Having your mother cat spayed (removing her womb) after the kittens are done nursing (they should be weaned by about 8 weeks) is highly recommended by veterinarians and humane organizations. This helps prevent the suffering of unwanted kittens, and can also have some health benefits for the spayed cat. Be aware that a cat can potentially fall pregnant again as little as three to four days after giving birth, so keep her indoors to avoid this risk.\n8. Start to think about deworming the kittens. This can happen as early as two weeks if necessary. Consult a veterinarian for proper medication and dosing.\n\n\n## Care for orphan kitten (0 to 4 weeks)\n\n1. Feed the kittens a milk replacement. Powdered cat milk replacer (such as Cimicat) can be purchased from the vet clinic, major pet stores, or on the Internet. Another good milk replacer is KMR. This is the cat equivalent of infant formula, with the same composition as queen's (mother's) milk. The milk replacer has guidelines as to how much to feed in each meal. Do not feed cow's milk to the kitten as the lactose is likely to upset the kitten's stomach. If you have no milk replacement and a hungry kitten, offer some cooled boiled water in a dropper or syringe until you can get to the vet clinic or pet store. The water keeps the kitten hydrated and won't upset her tummy.\n2. Use a kitten feeding bottle with a specially designed kitten teat. You can purchase this at a vet clinic, a major pet store, or on the Internet. In an emergency use an eyedropper or a small syringe to drip the milk replacement into the kitten's mouth.\n3. Burp the kittens after each meal. You do this much as you would a baby: hold the kitten up straight against your shoulder, or place one hand under its belly. Gently pat and rub its back.\n4. Stimulate the kittens to eliminate. Before and after each feed, wipe the kitten's bottom with a paper towel or gauze pad soaked in warm water. This stimulates the kitten to go to the toilet, which otherwise she would not do. Hold the kitten over a litter box and use the towel to rub the kitten's genitals and anal region after every meal. Continue to do this until the urination and defecation is over (when nothing else is coming out). Rub in just one direction\u2013rubbing back and forth is irritating. Cotton balls or pads are not recommended because they shed.\n5. Look for signs of healthy elimination. Urine should be pale yellow and odorless, and stools should be yellowish-brown, formed in tiny logs. Dark, pungent urine is a sign of dehydration; green stool may be a sign of over-feeding, while white stool could indicate malabsorption, a serious problem. Call your vet if you have any concerns. If the kitten does not urinate for 12 hours, take her to the vet's immediately. Most kittens poop once a day, but individual schedules vary. Take her to the vet's if she hasn't pooped in more than two days.\n6. Follow the kittens' meal times. In the first two weeks of life the kitten feeds every two to three hours around the clock. The kitten will tell you she is hungry by crying and wriggling around as if hunting for a nipple. A full kitten often falls asleep while suckling and has a rounded belly. After two weeks, the feeds can be stretched out to to every three to four hours, with a gap of six hours overnight.\n7. Keep the kittens warm with a covered heating pad. Neonatal kittens (under two weeks of age) cannot regulate their body temperature and usually keep warm by snuggling up to their mother. You can simulate this situation by keeping them on a heated pad designed for puppies or kittens. Avoid putting them in direct contact with the pad: if the kitten is in direct contact with the heat pad, she might be at risk of either local burns or overheating. However, these pads usually come in a fleece cover so it shouldn't be a problem, except for when you remove the cover for washing, in which case substitute a towel. As the kitten gets older (over two weeks), she is able to move away from the heat if she gets too hot.\n8. Never feed a cold kitten. If a kitten's body feels cold, you need to warm her up gradually. A kitten is cold if her ears and/or the pads of her feet feel chilly to the touch. Put your finger in her mouth: if it feels cold, the kitten's body temperature is too low, which can be life-threatening. Warm her up slowly by wrapping her in a fleece blanket and holding her next to your body, rubbing her gently with your hands for one to two hours.\n9. Learn more about taking care of orphaned kittens. You can start with this article. Contact a veterinarian for information and suggestions. Your vet can also provide vaccinations against common diseases and deworm the kittens. Orphaned kittens may be dewormed starting at two weeks, and, depending on their situation, can be vaccinated starting anywhere from two to eight weeks. They may have weaker immune systems because, unlike other kittens, they don't get the antibodies from their mother's milk.\n\n\n## Wean and socialize your kitten (4 - 8 weeks)\n\n1. Start to leave out extra kitten food. If Mom's around, the weaning process (switching from mother's milk to solid food) happens naturally from about four weeks. At this point, Mom gets tired of the kittens chewing on her teats and starts to spend time apart from them. In turn, the hungry kittens investigate food options around them and usually discover Mom's food. As the kittens start to take mouthfuls of her food, they begin the weaning process.\n2. Provide water. Kittens do not need water until they start weaning, roughly around four weeks old. Any kitten above this age, however, should have constant access to a full water bowl. Change this water whenever it gets dirty (as it tends to if kittens step and/or poop in the bowl).\n3. Put down kitten food for hand-reared kittens. If you've been bottle-feeding the kittens yourself, the weaning process is similar. It sometimes helps to put some milk-replacer in a saucer and put your finger just beneath the surface to teach the kitten to lap first. Then, it's a matter of mashing up some wet kitten food with the milk-replacer to make a porridge for the kitten to lap. As she gets the hang of that you can thicken up the porridge until she's happily taking most of her calories in solid form.\n4. Socialize your kittens by introducing them to new things. Socialization is crucial during the three-to-nine-week window. From two to three weeks of age, handle the kittens as much as possible every day. Introduce them to different sights and sounds, such as the vacuum cleaner, hair dryer, men with beards, children . . . anything you can think of. During this six-week window the kitten is most open to new experiences, and what she encounters now she will accept without question as an adult, making her into a happy, well-adjusted and sociable cat. Use cat toys, balls, string, or other objects to play with them, but don't use objects small enough for them to swallow. (Note that cats may eat string or yarn if left unsupervised, so only allow this in your interactive play. It's a potential choking hazard.) Don't teach your kittens that human fingers and hands are toys, or the kitten may continue to bite and scratch them as an adult.\n5. Provide non-clumping litter. Choose a spot for the litter box carefully, as once used to it, the kittens will probably continue to use that spot. If litter-training the kittens yourself, simply place the kittens there after each meal, or whenever a kitten starts to crouch and scratch the floor in preparation for pooping. Clean the litter box at least once a day, or the kittens may stop using it. Choose a box with low sides so it's easy for the kittens to get in and out. Avoid clumping litter, as kittens may eat the clumps, which could potentially harm their digestion. If a kitten seems like it doesn't want to stay in the litter box, gently take its paws and imitate digging in the litter. Then, provide the kitten with privacy so it can dig a hole, do its business, and cover it up with some litter.\n6. Keep the cat inside until it has all its shots. Once your veterinarian allows it, you can let the cat outside to explore. Make sure you keep a close watch on it until you're sure it knows to return home. Let the kitten outside when it's a bit hungry. Entice it back in by calling its name and showing it food. This will remind your kitten that while outdoors is fun, its final destination will always be your home.\n7. Give kittens away responsibly. If selling or giving away the kittens, you should wait until they are at least eight weeks old, but twelve weeks old is preferred. Take them to a vet and start their shots before they leave you. Always follow-up with the new owners to make sure the kitten is getting her shots and is scheduled to be spayed or neutered. Exchange phone numbers with the new owners so you can confirm your kitten is in good hands, or in case the owners want to return her (at least you can help her find another home).\n\n\n## Take care of an adopt kitten (8 weeks and beyond)\n\n1. Ask the breeder or shelter for a blanket that smells like the kitten's mother and siblings. These smells help to give the kitten comfort while she settles into her new home.\n2. Ask what kind of food the kitten's been eating. Provide this for the first few days so that you don't make too many changes at once. When the kitten has settled in, this is your chance to change her food to one of your choosing, though do it gradually: replace a small quantity of her former food with the new food, increasing the amount slowly over the course of a week. If the kitten is eating dry kibble, leave a bowl out all day. If she is eating wet food, give her small meals every six hours. Continue to feed kitten food, not adult cat food, until one year of age.\n3. Provide water. Kittens above four weeks of age need water, so clean water should always be available. Cats tend to be more interested in water that is not next to their food bowl. Encourage drinking by placing water bowls in different spots through the house.\n4. Introduce the kitten to your house slowly. Expose the kitten to just one room initially: the whole house will be too overwhelming on the first day. Set up a bed (preferably one that has sides and a roof so the kitten feels safe in a nest), with food and water in one corner of the room, and a litter tray in the opposite corner. Show the kitten where her facilities are, and then leave her to rest. It's been a big day for the little kitten so let her adjust and sleep for a few hours.\n5. Give the kitten as much attention as you can. Spend as much time as possible grooming, playing, fussing and interacting with the kitten. This helps her to grow into a well-socialized, friendly adult.\n6. Keep the kitten and your possessions safe. Keep electrical cords and devices out of the kitten's reach to avoid her chewing on them. Child locks may be a wise investment for low cabinets if you have a particularly inquisitive kitten.\n7. Plan a vet visit. At nine weeks old the kitten can have her first vaccination. This is the ideal time for a vet to examine her, worm her and start vaccinations. The basic kitten vaccine includes protection against cat flu and infectious enteritis. There is also the option to vaccinate against feline leukemia.\n", "prediction_0": "Taking care of kittens involves providing them with a safe and comfortable environment, proper nutrition, socialization, and regular veterinary care.

{"question": "How to be organized during the holidays?", "answer": "## Personal holiday organization\n\n1. Plan for sleep. One of the dangers of the holiday season is that you schedule too much and don't budget enough time for sleep and exercise. These 2 practices can cut your stress level in half and make it easier to stay on task during your holiday rush. It is common to reduce your exercise time slightly during the holidays, but try to get about 30 minutes of mid-intensity cardiovascular exercise 5 times per week. Don't not cut down on your sleep; aim for 8 hours per night. Moderate your alcohol intake. Although it may seem like a sedative, it can actually prevent you from getting deep sleep. Stop after a few drinks to avoid losing your energy the next day.\n2. Set a budget 2 months before the holidays. Take into account how much you can afford and then split the money between cards, postage stamps, gifts, decorations, clothing, food and even a party. Plan an overage of 10 percent in your budget. This means all of your needs should add up to 90 percent of the money you have for the holidays.\n3. Sit down with your family 6 weeks before the holiday and ask for help. If you love control, this may be hard to do; however, it will take a load off your shoulders and make everyone feel like the holidays don't come together magically.\n4. Discuss the possibility of doing a low-gift giving Christmas or a charity project with your family. If your budget is tight, then giving 1 present or buying 1 big present for the whole family might be better. Studies have also shown that charity projects can help your emotional health during stressful times.\n5. Book travel plans 3 or more months before the holidays. Ticket prices tend to go up right before the holidays. Make sure you have lower travel costs and less stress associated with travel if you and your children or parents have their plans figured out in advance.\n6. Use a calendar that everyone can see, online or in the house. Place all commitments, deadlines, family nights and tasks on it so that everyone can refer back to it over the month of December.\n\n\n## Holiday shop organization\n\n1. Schedule shopping intelligently rather than in blocks. The following are good tips that make holiday shopping more effective and quick:\n\t* Buy things throughout the year, whenever you see something that is ideal for someone. You provide more thoughtful gifts if they are catered to the person, rather than bought frantically the month before. Store your gifts in 1 place in your house and come back to your gift hiding place 6 weeks before Chanukah or Christmas. Take a few hours off work during mid-week once the holiday sales start. You will miss the rush and have a more calm shopping experience. Shop in small spurts online. Getting online for hours can be a waste of time. Keep a list in your purse of things you are looking for, and add to it. Wait until you have 2 or 3 things you know you want to search for and do your power shopping. Open 3 browser tabs and compare prices on Amazon, Overtock.com and a Google Shopping page. Don't be afraid to give gift certificates. Many stores, massage parlors, movie theaters and more provide gift certificates. Think of something that your friends or family will find truly valuable over a product you are unsure they will like.\n2. Set up a wrapping station on a table in late November or early December. Wrap gifts as soon as you bring them home. This will remove the chance that children will find their gifts and it will allow you to get both shopping and wrapping done at a slow and steady pace.\n3. Aim to finish your shopping and wrapping by December 15th. Schedule your time accordingly, so that you can enjoy the holidays and be ready for any last-minute changes.\n\n\n## Holiday cook organization\n\n1. Clean your kitchen from top to bottom before attempting holiday baking or cooking. Try to do this in late November or early December. Rearrange things that overnight guests will need, such as coffee and cereal, in an easy to reach cupboard and create a baking cupboard.\n2. Stock up on baking supplies early in the season. Buy flour, sugar and spices at warehouse stores so that you don't have to make late night runs to the supermarket. Buy some pre-made pie crusts and cookies to keep around in case you don't have time to do everything from scratch.\n3. Bake throughout the holiday season. Clear out your freezer, and then create a cooking to do list that allows you to make and freeze items every week. For example, bake 1 sweet, such as cookies or candy, and prepare 1 side dish in preparation. Cover and label the dishes very well before you stack them on a freezer. For example, \"Sweet Potatoes. Thaw and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.\"\n4. Plan a holiday potluck party instead of baking all of the food. This is a great way to lower your budget and have fun. Allow people to bring desserts, side dishes or relish to family dinners as well; they understand your kitchen is very full.\n", "prediction_0": "The holidays can be a busy and chaotic time, but being organized can help reduce stress and ensure that you enjoy the season to the fullest.

{"question": "I've noticed that people on YouTube and even on TV would sometimes say things like \"I used to take lots of coke a few years ago\" or \"I used to smoke weed daily until this and that\" or \"Yea, I smoke weed every once in a while,\" or \"I used to pirate games a lot when I was a bit younger\" or \"I used pirated Windows and Photoshop until I got a job,\" etc., etc..\nBasically they are confessing to a crime, on public record, couldn't anyone come after them? They've already confessed - technically all that would have to be done is a trial.\nHow do people publicly admit to criminal activity and not typically get arrested?", "answer": "Unless the Youtube Video shows them committing a crime, then no, they couldn't be arrested and tried for a crime. Them saying it, not under oath, is just hearsay that has no evidentiary value unless there is already other evidence they have committed a crime. In that case, its an admission.  But there must be other, either circumstantial, or actual physical evidence of a crime.\n\nPast intoxication is not a crime, either. Possession of drugs, if caught with them is. But saying you got high is not.\n\nPeople have walked into police stations and confessed to murders. But with no evidence, no body, no name of a missing person, they can't even be held after the holding period for investigatory purposes expires. \n\nIf the video shows them committing assault, or breaking and entering (there actually are idiots who post this stuff), the video is actual evidence of a crime and it is often used against them. The statements can be used to begin an investigation, but people don't usually confess to anything worth pursuing even an investigation. The fact that someone says they used to do something criminal is not enough. For all you ( meaning anyone ) knows, the statute of limitations has expired because they \"pirated games\" 10 years ago. Your comment is right on.", "prediction_0": "While it may seem that people are openly admitting to criminal activities when they share anecdotes about their past, there are some important factors to consider that help explain why they are not typically arrested as a result.\n\nFirst and foremost, the law distinguishes between acknowledging past criminal behavior and actively engaging in criminal activity. When someone states that they used to engage in piracy or illegal drug use in the past, they are merely sharing information about their past experiences. They are not currently engaging in any illegal activity and are not inciting anyone else to do so.\n\nAdditionally, many of the acts that people confess to, such as piracy or drug use, are not necessarily high-priority enforcement targets for law enforcement agencies. Resources are limited, and they are typically focused on more serious and ongoing criminal activity.\n\nFurthermore, there is often a significant time gap between when the criminal behavior occurred and when it is being discussed publicly. During that time, the statute of limitations may have expired for some crimes, further reducing the likelihood that anyone would be arrested for these past actions.\n\nFinally, it's important to note that making a confession in a public forum does carry some risks. Anyonewho makes such a confession could potentially be targeted by individuals or groups seeking to exploit the situation. Additionally, any confession could have consequences for personal relationships, employment opportunities, and other areas of life. As a result, people who make such confessions may do so with a degree of caution and awareness of the potential consequences.", "prediction_1": "It's important to note that making a statement about past participation in an illegal activity, such as drug use or pirating software, is not the same as committing the crime itself. While it may be frowned upon socially or ethically, it is generally not sufficient evidence for law enforcement to make an arrest.\n\nFor a crime to be prosecuted, there must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime was committed and that the person accused committed that crime. Merely making a statement about past criminal behavior is not enough to meet this standard.\n\nFurthermore, many of the activities you mentioned, such as past drug use or software piracy, are not current crimes in many jurisdictions. In some cases, they may have been decriminalized or considered less of a priority for law enforcement.\n\nIt's also worth noting that many people make such statements in a casual or exaggerated way, without intending to actually confess to an ongoing criminal activity. Such statements may be more of a reflection of social norms or a way to connect with an audience, rather than a genuine confession.\n\nUltimately, if someone is currently engaged in illegal activity and publicly admits to it, they may still face legal consequences. However, mere past participation in an illegal activity is generally not enough to lead to an arrest or prosecution.", "prediction_2": "There are a few reasons why people can publicly admit to criminal activity without getting arrested:\n\n1. Statute of Limitations: In many cases, the statute of limitations for the crime has passed. For example, in the United States, the statute of limitations for most misdemeanors is one to three years, and for felonies it can be three to ten years or even longer. Once the statute of limitations has expired, it is generally not possible to prosecute the case.\n2. Decriminalization or Legalization: In some cases, the criminal activity has become decriminalized or even legal. For example, in some states in the US, it is now legal to use marijuana recreationally, so admitting to using it in the past would not be a criminal confession.\n3. Amnesty Programs: Some jurisdictions offer amnesty programs for certain crimes, which allow people to come forward and confess to the crime without fear of prosecution. For example, some jurisdictions have offered amnesty programs for people who have used or possessed illegal drugs.\n4. context: Sometimes people use language that makes it clear that they are speaking metaphorically or figuratively, not literally. For example, someone might say \"I used to smoke a packet of cigarettes a day\" to mean that they used to smoke a lot, but not literally smoke an entire packet every day.\n5. freedom of speech: People have the right to express themselves and share their experiences, even if those experiences involve criminal activity in the past. The fact that someone has admitted to a crime publicly does not necessarily mean that they are currently committing the crime or intend to commit it in the future.\n\nIt's important to note that admitting to criminal activity publicly does not always mean that there will be no consequences. For example, someone who admits to illegal drug use on a resume or in a job interview could be denied employment as a result. Additionally, admitting to certain crimes, such as fraud or embezzlement, could result in civil lawsuits or other legal consequences.", "prediction_3": "It is important to note that publicly admitting to committing a criminal act does not automatically result in arrest or legal consequences. In many cases, people make such admissions in a context that does not provide enough information for law enforcement to take action, or the admitted acts may not be criminal under the specific laws that apply.\n\nFor example, in the case of drug use, possession of small quantities of certain substances for personal use may be decriminalized or even legal in some jurisdictions. In other cases, the admissions may be made in a context such as a confessional setting or entertainment industry, where the goal is not to facilitate criminal investigations but rather to share personal stories or experiences.\n\nMoreover, law enforcement agencies generally prioritize their resources to investigate and prosecute criminal acts that pose the greatest threats to public safety and health. In some cases, investigating individuals for past criminal behavior that has not resulted in harm to others may not be a priority.\n\nThat being said, it is important to be aware that some criminal activities, such as piracy, can still have legal consequences even if the perpetrator has publicly admitted to the crime. In some cases, individuals may be targeted for civil litigation or have their personal information shared with copyright owners or law enforcement agencies, which could lead to investigations and potential legal action.\n\nUltimately, the decision to pursue legal action for past criminal activities rests with law enforcement and the judicial system. While publicly admitting to such activities may increase the visibility of the person and their actions, it does not necessarily result in immediate arrest or legal consequences.", "prediction_4": "While it may seem contradictory that individuals can publicly admit to engaging in criminal activities without facing immediate arrest, there are several reasons why this is the case. The following are a few possible explanations:\n\n1. Decriminalization or Legalization: In some cases, the criminal activity may no longer be considered a crime. For example, some jurisdictions have decriminalized or even legalized the use of marijuana. In such cases, individuals may freely admit to using marijuana without fear of legal repercussions.\n2. Statute of Limitations: Many criminal offenses have a statute of limitations, which is the time limit within which legal proceedings can be initiated. Once the statute of limitations has expired, it may no longer be possible to bring charges against an individual.\n3. Context and Intent: When individuals make such admissions, they are often speaking in a casual or confessional context. These admissions are not necessarily formal confessions made under oath or for the purpose of obtaining leniency in sentencing. Additionally, an admission to past criminal conduct does not automatically mean that the individual is currently engaged in such activity.\n4. Amnesty or Immunity Programs: In certain cases, law enforcement or government agencies may offer amnesty or immunity programs for individuals who confess to specific criminal activities. Such programs may be intended to encourage individuals to come forward with information or to encourage them to stop engaging in criminal activity.\n5. Freedom of Expression: There is a legal principle known as freedom of expression, which protects individuals' right to express their thoughts and opinions without fear of prosecution, provided that such expression does not constitute a clear and present danger or incite violent or illegal activity. Casual admissions of past criminal conduct may fall within the protection of this principle.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this is not a definitive list, and each case may have unique factors that influence whether an individual can publicly admit to criminal activity without facing arrest. Additionally, making such admissions may have other consequences, such as damage to reputation or professional opportunities. It is always a good idea for individuals to consult with legal counsel if they have concerns about potential criminal liability."}
{"question": "I see a low use of Mathematica in Kaggle competitions. Why would one use the Wolfram Language versus R, Python, or Julia for machine learning?

So here are a few examples...\nLet's say you were building an app that used the moment package to parse and display dates. Your app is a scheduler so it really needs this package to run, as in: cannot run without it. In this case you would use\n```npm install moment --save\n```\nThis would create a new value in your package.json\n```&quot;dependencies&quot;: {\n   ...\n   &quot;moment&quot;: &quot;^2.17.1&quot;\n}\n```\nWhen you are developing, it really helps to use tools such as test suites and may need jasmine-core and karma.

You can see how if you do not understand what is really happening, it is a bit hard to imagine.\nTaken directly from NPM docs docs#dependencies\n\n> Dependencies \n> Dependencies are specified in a simple object that maps a package name to a version range. The version range is a string that has one or more space-separated descriptors. Dependencies can also be identified with a tarball or git URL.

So since you passed ```await``` an array (of Promise objects) here instead of a Promise, the value returned by await is simply that array, which is of type ```Promise[]```.\nWhat you probably want to do is call ```Promise.all``` on the array returned by ```map``` in order to convert it to a single Promise before ```await```ing it.\nAccording to the MDN docs for ```Promise.all```:\n\nThe ```Promise.all(iterable)``` method returns a promise that resolves\nwhen all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved, or\nrejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects.\n\nSo in your case:\n```var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nvar results: number[] = await Promise.all(arr.map(async (item): Promise => {\n    await callAsynchronousOperation(item);\n    return item + 1;\n}));\n```\nThis will resolve the specific error you are encountering here.\nDepending on exactly what it is you're trying to do you may also consider using ```Promise.allSettled```, ```Promise.any```, or ```Promise.race``` instead of ```Promise.all```, though in most situations (almost certainly including this one) ```Promise.all``` will be the one you want.", "prediction_0": "To make `async/await` and `Array.map()` work together in TypeScript, you need to use the `Promise.all()` method to wait for all the promises returned by `map()` to be resolved, and then assign the resulting array of resolved values to the `results` variable.

The `Promise.all()` method is then used to wait for all the promises to be resolved, and the resulting values are mapped to an array of numbers using `then()` and `map()`. Note, the `results` is of type `Promise<number[]>` which will be `number[]` after resolution.\n\nYour `callAsynchronousOperation()` function should return a promise for the code above to work correctly.

We also use a single promise to represent the entire mapping process and resolve it with an array of results.\n\nHowever, this solution creates a couple of issues:\n\n1. We have to use extra variables and helper functions for creating the promise chain, which can make the code less readable.\n2. We have to call the `then` function with extra parameters to chain the promises.\n\nA more elegant solution would be using `Promise.all` instead of `Array.map`:\n\n```typescript\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nasync function processArray(): Promise<number[]> {\n  let results: Promise<number>[] = arr.map(async (item) => {\n    return callAsynchronousOperation(item).then((value) => value + 1);\n  });\n\n  return Promise.all(results).then((values) => values.map((value) => value));\n}\n\n// Assign the result to a \"results\" variable of type \"number[]\" after the function is called\nprocessArray().then((result) => {\n  results = result;\n  console.log(results);\n});\n```\n\nWith this approach, we create an array of promises using `Array.map`, and the `Promise.all` function waits for all of them to resolve before returning an array of results.

{"question": "In general, there are two types of syntax of defining functions - Something like C, C++, C#, or Java (```int functionName(char arg)```) vs the ML (and others) tradition of defining the return type after the function (and using something like a ```fun``` keyword to define a function - like ```fun functionName(char arg): int```).\nOne of the advantages (for the parser, at least) for a ```fun``` keyword is that it lets the parser be context-free (it doesn't have to guess if ```int``` defines a variable or if it defines a function).\nWhen C was invented, computers had very little memory and speed (so little, that the reason C requires one to define all the variables in the beginning of the function was because it had to be a one-pass parser). Why didn't they choose the simple way out and use function defining keyword?", "answer": "Dennis Ritchie\u2019s paper on The Development of the C Language gives some idea of the reasoning behind this: namely, the fundamental rule in C that declaration syntax should match expression syntax\"\n\nFor each object of such a composed type, there was already a way to mention the underlying object: index the array, call the function, use the indirection operator on the pointer. Analogical reasoning led to a declaration syntax for names mirroring that of the expression syntax in which the names typically appear. Thus,\n```int i, *pi, **ppi;\n```\ndeclare an integer, a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a pointer to an integer. The syntax of these declarations reflects the observation that ```i```, ```*pi```, and ```**ppi``` all yield an ```int``` type when used in an expression. Similarly,\n```int f(), *f(), (*f)();\n```\ndeclare a function returning an integer, a function returning a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a function returning an integer;\n```int *api[10], (*pai)[10];\n```\ndeclare an array of pointers to integers, and a pointer to an array of integers. In all these cases the declaration of a variable resembles its usage in an expression whose type is the one named at the head of the declaration.\n\n\nIt appears this rule trumped parser considerations. Its immediate consequence is that function declarations can\u2019t use specific keywords, or impose a different ordering of declaration components.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that parsing was somewhat different in early C, since function declarations didn\u2019t specify their arguments, and function definitions separated the argument list from the argument declarations (which weren\u2019t necessary for ```int``` arguments):\n```sum();\n```\ndeclares a ```sum``` function, which would then be defined as\n```sum(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n(no types needed here, the default is ```int```). So the parser didn\u2019t deal with types inside argument lists.", "prediction_0": "When C was developed in the 1970s, the primary consideration was not making the parser context-free or memory efficient, but rather making the language easy to use and efficient for system programming. C was designed to be a low-level, flexible language that could be used to write operating systems and other system software.\n\nIn the early days of programming, memory was indeed a scarce resource, but the primary reason for having all variables declared at the beginning of a function was not due to the one-pass parsing requirement, but rather to make it easier for the compiler to optimize the code. By declaring all variables at the beginning of a function, the compiler could keep track of their memory locations and ensure that they were properly initialized before they were used.\n\nRegarding function definitions, C chose to use the syntax of placing the data type before the function name to make it consistent with the variable declaration syntax. This syntax was also more concise and easier to read in some cases, as it allowed the return type to be immediately apparent. Using a separate keyword like \"fun\" to define a function would have made the syntax more verbose and less consistent with the rest of the language.\n\nIt's worth noting that C does allow for implicit function declarations in some cases, where a function is used before it is explicitly declared. This feature can lead to compile-time errors or even runtime errors if the function is not defined properly. In contrast, explicit function declarations using the \"functionName(args)\" syntax make it clear to the programmer (and the compiler) that a function is being defined or declared, reducing the likelihood of errors.", "prediction_1": "When C was developed in the 1970s, programming languages and compilers were still in their infancy. The designers of C, including Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, chose the syntax they did for a few reasons that were related to the specific goals and constraints of the time.\n\nOne of the primary goals of C was to provide a low-level, efficient language for system programming. C offered more control over memory management and hardware interfaces than high-level languages like BASIC and FORTRAN. To achieve this efficiency, the C language designers prioritized compiler optimization and kept the syntax simple and concise.\n\nThe syntax for function definitions in C, where the return type is written before the function name, was a conscious design choice that facilitated lexical analysis and optimization of the compiler. By requiring the return type to be declared before the function name, the compiler could parse the return type without having to consider whether it was part of a function definition or a variable declaration. This approach helped the compiler to be more deterministic and efficient in its parsing and optimization.\n\nAt the time of C's development, memory and processing power were still quite limited, and parsing code efficiently was an important consideration for both compilers and developers. Since the syntax for declaring functions with the return type first was more straightforward for the compiler to parse than the ML-style syntax, the C language designers opted for it.\n\nAnother factor was the existing programming paradigms and syntax of the time. C was significantly influenced by earlier programming languages like BCPL and Algol60, which used a similar syntax for function declarations. The designers of C also wanted to maintain backward compatibility with BCPL and Algol60 as much as possible, which made adopting a different syntax less appealing.\n\nIn summary, while the ML-style syntax for function definitions may have seemed simpler to us today, the designers of C prioritized efficiency, deterministic parsing, and backward compatibility when they chose the syntax they did. These considerations were important for the goals and constraints of system programming in the late 1960s and early 1970s.", "prediction_2": "When C was invented in the late 1960s and early 1970s, computer systems were still relatively limited in terms of memory and processing power compared to today's standards. One-pass parsing was adopted in C for several reasons, including:\n\n1. Simplicity: One-pass parsing was simpler to implement than a context-free parser like the one used in functional programming languages with a `fun` keyword. The C language designers favored a more straightforward approach, especially given the limitations of the hardware and software environments of the time.\n\n2. Compilation Efficiency: One-pass parsing made the compilation process more efficient. Since variable declarations were required at the beginning of each block, the compiler could easily keep track of memory usage and allocation. This meant that the compiler could generate more optimized machine code and use memory more efficiently.\n\n3. Readability: Allocating memory for variables at the beginning of a function block also made the code easier to read. Developers could quickly see which variables were in scope and how they were used throughout the function.\n\n4. Compatibility with Assembly Language: C was designed to be a low-level systems programming language, and it aimed to provide a consistent interface between the high-level C language and the underlying assembly language. The requirement to declare all variables at the beginning of a block was a holdover from the assembly language programming style, which facilitated direct manipulation of memory.\n\n5. Consistency: The C language designers wanted to maintain consistency with other programming languages of the time, such as Fortran and Algol. Although these languages did not use the exact same syntax as C, they shared similar characteristics regarding variable declarations and function definitions.\n\nThese factors played a role in the decision to adopt the one-pass parsing approach for C and not use a `fun` keyword like in functional programming languages. However, it's essential to note that these design choices were made in a specific historical context, and modern programming languages have evolved and adapted to improve upon those initial designs.", "prediction_3": "When C was designed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the primary consideration was to make the language efficient for programming systems and embedded systems with limited resources, such as memory and processing power. C was designed to be a low-level systems programming language and was influenced by earlier languages like BCPL and ALGOL.\n\nC's designers chose to use a single keyword (\"int\" or \"float\" etc.) to define both variables and functions with the same return type. This was an intentional design choice aimed at keeping the syntax simple and reducing the parser's complexity. At the time, memory and processing power were scarce, and every byte and cycle counted.\n\nHowever, using a single keyword for both variables and functions created ambiguity in the parser, as it had to determine the context in which the keyword was being used. In function declarations, the keywords indicated the return type of the function, but in variable declarations, they defined the data type of the variable.\n\nDespite the potential ambiguity, C remained a popular choice for system programming due to its simplicity and efficiency, and its design influenced later languages like C++ and C#.\n\nThe ML-style functional programming language syntax, with its explicit \"fun\" keyword for function definitions, emerged later as an alternative approach, which addressed the ambiguity issue by clearly separating function definitions from variable declarations. It also became popular among functional programming communities due to its simplicity and expressiveness for defining higher-order functions.\n\nSo, in summary, the lack of a clear \"fun\" keyword in C may have been a deliberate design choice aimed at simplifying and minimizing the syntax, even if it introduced some ambiguity in the parser. Later on, as programming paradigms evolved, the ML-style syntax emerged as a better fit for functional programming paradigms.", "prediction_4": "When C was developed in the 1970s, the design choices were influenced by several factors, including the available technology, programming practices at the time, and the objectives of the C language designers.\n\nOne of the primary reasons C used the function declaration style without a dedicated keyword like `fun` was due to the influence of BCPL, a programming language developed before C. BCPL used a similar style of declaring functions without a separate keyword. Brian Kernighan, one of the primary authors of the C language, was an influential figure in the C design team, and he was familiar with BCPL.\n\nAnother factor was the C language's focus on system programming and low-level manipulation of hardware. Having a clear distinction between variable declarations and function declarations was desirable to make the code more readable and easier to understanding for system programming tasks.\n\nThe C language designers also aimed for a simple, clean design with minimal syntax, and the omission of a function keyword was a reflection of that design philosophy. While a function keyword might make the parsing process simpler for some modern compilers, the C language designers prioritized other design principles in the language's development.\n\nLastly, it's important to note that it is not entirely accurate to say that the C language required defining all variables at the beginning of functions due to memory constraints alone. While it might have made parsing simpler in the early days when memory was limited, the C language has evolved to support other ways of defining variables, such as within blocks using the curly brace syntax. However, this early design decision has stuck throughout the evolution of the C language, and its use of declaring all variables at the beginning of functions is now a common idiom in C programming."}

{"question": "How to know what to charge for babysitting?", "answer": "Babysitting is a great way to earn money and get experience taking care of children, but figuring out how much to charge for your time can be tricky. Many babysitters don\u2019t have much work experience, and they feel bad asking for money. Remember, your time is valuable and you deserve to be paid fairly! Figure out a good base rate by talking with babysitters and parents in your area. You can also use an online babysitting rate calculator. Then charge more based on how many children you\u2019re sitting, their needs, your skills, and your transportation costs.\n\n## Set a base rate\n\n1. Ask other babysitters you know what they charge. If you know anybody else who babysits, ask them what they charge. Once you have multiple opinions, you can see what the average is. Since they live in your area, they\u2019ll know what a reasonable rate is for where you live. Different areas have very different rates, depending on what people\u2019s average income is. Ask a fellow babysitter, \u201cI\u2019m a new babysitter and am trying to figure out what to charge. I was wondering how much you charge per hour?\u201d\n\t* Major cities and their suburbs generally pay higher rates than small towns. In New York City and L.A., sitters charge about $20 an hour, while in Houston and Chicago they charge $15.\n2. Use an online rate calculator. The internet has a lot of babysitting rate calculators that allow you to put in your zip code and how many years of babysitting experience you have. It will calculate the average rate. One example is https://www.care.com/babysitting-rates.\n3. Ask parents you know what they pay for babysitters. Ask trusted adults in your area how much they pay their babysitters. This will help you get an idea of how much people are willing to pay. Once you have an idea, propose it to your client, and see if they think it\u2019s fair. Keep in mind that parents will pay more per hour for a qualified nanny than for a teenage babysitter. Parents will also pay differently for full-time babysitting than for occasional nights or weekends.\n4. Look up what the minimum wage is in your area. Too many babysitters settle for less than minimum wage because they\u2019re not sure what it is, or because the job is less official than jobs that require work permits. Counties and cities calculate the minimum wage based on what they think is a fair amount to give someone for an hour of their time, so you should charge at least that. If you\u2019re underage to work at a regular job or are undocumented, you should still ask for the minimum wage. You deserve to be paid fairly.\n\n\n## Increase your base rate\n\n1. Increase your rate when you gain experience and qualifications. The more babysitting experience you have, the more skilled and qualified you are. Also, the older you are, the more you can charge. Increase your rate when you pass big milestones like graduating middle school or high school. Charge more if you have extra skills, like CPR certification or camp counselor experience.\n2. Charge more if there are more children. Once you\u2019ve settled on a reasonable base rate, charge more money (maybe 5 dollars more per hour) for each additional child you\u2019re asked to look after. Watching 1 or 2 children is very different from watching 5 children, so make sure you\u2019re comfortable with it before saying yes to the job. Also, consider asking your client if you can bring a co-babysitter along with you for large groups of children. The client should pay both babysitters a reasonable rate for this to be a fair deal.\n3. Charge more for special needs and skills. If the child you\u2019re being asked to watch is an infant who requires constant supervision, diaper changing, and bottles, you can charge more than if you\u2019re watching a 10 year old. If the child has special needs or is particularly rambunctious or difficult to manage, you should also charge more, because you will have specialized skills to take care of them. Offer the price you think is fair considering the amount of physical and emotional energy that goes into caring for that child.\n4. Increase your rate if they ask you to do extra chores. You should feel free to charge more if your client asks you to do household chores like sweeping, mopping, dishes, laundry, grocery shopping, and cooking. You can also charge more if they ask you to care for their pets or help their children with their homework. The more tasks they ask you to do outside of just watching their child, the more you can charge for your hourly rate.\n5. Factor in transportation. If you have to travel a long time to get to your babysitting job, you should charge for your commute. Talk to your client about ways to do this. You can include your commute-time in the amount of time you\u2019re compensated for. Another way is to have your client pay for your gas money or your bus tickets, depending on how you are getting there. If you have to bike or walk to your babysitting job in the dark, make sure you feel safe. Otherwise, you should refuse the job, or ask for different hours. Don\u2019t accept a ride from an unfamiliar babysitting client. It may not be safe.\n6. Ask for more payment for babysitting on holidays. If your client asks you to work on Christmas, Valentine\u2019s Day, New Year\u2019s Eve, or some other special occasion, you should charge more. First of all, you\u2019re giving up having a fun time, and you should only do that for the big bucks. And secondly, the client will be willing to pay more, because it\u2019s hard to find sitters on nights like that. On the other hand, if you\u2019re babysitting in the middle of a Sunday afternoon, you\u2019ll probably get less money than babysitting on a Saturday night, when your clients want to go on a date night.\n", "prediction_0": "Determining what to charge for babysitting can depend on several factors, including your experience, the number of children you'll be taking care of, the age of the children, and the length of time you'll be babysitting. Here are some general guidelines to help you set a babysitting rate:\n\n1. Research the average babysitting rates in your area: Look up the average babysitting rates in your local community. You can check websites like Care.com, Sittercity, or Craigslist for babysitting job postings in your area to see what rates are being offered. You can also ask other babysitters or parents in your network about their rates.\n2. Consider your experience and qualifications: The more experience you have, the more you can charge for your services. Take into account any training or certifications you have, such as CPR, First Aid, or child development courses.\n3. Consider the number and ages of the children: Babysitting multiple children, especially those of different ages, can be more challenging than babysitting one child, so factor that into your rate. Older children tend to require less supervision than younger children, so consider that when determining your rate based on the number and ages of the children.\n4. Consider the length of time you'll be babysitting: Longer babysitting sessions should typically come with a higher rate, as you'll be committing more time to the family.\n5. Be competitive but fair: It's important to set a rate that's competitive with other babysitters in your area, but also fair to yourself. Don't undervalue your services based on fear of losing business to someone charging less.\n\nUltimately, it's important to set a babysitting rate that's comfortable for you while also being competitive in your local market.

Consider your experience: If you have a lot of experience babysitting or working with children, you may be able to charge more than someone who is just starting out.\n3. Evaluate the number and age of children: The more children you'll be caring for, and the younger they are, the more challenging the babysitting job will be. You may need to charge more to cover the additional time and energy required.\n4. Factor in any additional responsibilities: If you'll be preparing meals or doing household chores during the babysitting shift, be sure to include that in your rate.\n5. Consider traveling time: If you'll be traveling to the family's home or they'll be coming to your home, be sure to factor in the time and gas cost for travel.\n6. Be flexible: Your rate may need to be adjusted based on the specific needs of the family, such as if they have multiple children or if they require you to stay later than usual.\n7. Discuss your rate with the family: Have an open and honest conversation with the family about your rate and what it includes. Be prepared to explain why you charge what you do and be open to negotiating if necessary.\n8.

Age of Children: Babysitting younger children typically requires more attention and preparation, so you may want to charge more for this age group. Conversely, older children may require less supervision, so you may charge less.\n3. Duration of the Sitting Session: Generally, the longer the sitting session, the more you can charge. However, some parents may be willing to pay a higher hourly rate for a shorter period if they have an event or a specific time frame they need coverage for.\n4. Location: Consider the cost of living in your area and the average babysitting rates in your community.

The maximum number of times an element may\n  appear is determined by the value of a maxOccurs attribute in its\n  declaration. This value may be a positive integer such as 41, or the\n  term unbounded to indicate there is no maximum number of occurrences.\n  The default value for both the minOccurs and the maxOccurs attributes\n  is 1. Thus, when an element such as comment is declared without a\n  maxOccurs attribute, the element may not occur more than once. Be sure\n  that if you specify a value for only the minOccurs attribute, it is\n  less than or equal to the default value of maxOccurs, i.e. it is 0 or 1.\n  Similarly, if you specify a value for only the maxOccurs attribute, it must be greater than or equal to the default value of minOccurs,\n  i.e. 1 or more.

So, the element can occur zero or more times, but it can also occur an arbitrary number of times.\n\nHowever, some XML schema processors or applications may have different interpretations or restrictions, so it's essential to follow best practices and explicitly define the `maxOccurs` attribute to make your schemaclear and unambiguous.\n\nRegarding your second question, the cardinality `[0..2]` or `[1..2]` can be defined using the `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs` attributes together:\n\n```xml\n<element name=\"element_name\" type=\"type_name\">\n  <complexType>\n    <sequence>\n      <element name=\"sub_element_name\" type=\"sub_type_name\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"2\"/>\n    </sequence>\n  </complexType>\n</element>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `sub_element_name` can occur between zero and two times in the sequence of the parent element.", "prediction_1": "According to the XML Schema specification, if an element does not have a maxOccurs attribute defined, it defaults to 1 (cardinality [1..1]). This means that the element is required and can only occur once in the document.\n\nRegarding your second question, if an element does not have a maxOccurs attribute and you're asking whether it could be [0..2] or [1..2], then the answer is that it depends on the context of the XML Schema. If the element is defined inside an element that allows multiple occurrences, then it could potentially have a cardinality of [0..2] or [1..2]. However, without explicitly defining the maxOccurs value, there's no definitive answer as to which cardinality it actually has. Therefore, it's generally a best practice to explicitly define the cardinality in the XML Schema to avoid any ambiguity.", "prediction_2": "In XML Schema, the absence of a `maxOccurs` attribute or the value being set to \"unbounded\" (indicated by an asterisk `*`) in an element definition means that the element can occur any number of times, including zero times. This is equivalent to the cardinality \"[0..unbounded]\" in XSD.\n\nFor example, consider:\n\n```xml\n<xs:element name=\"myElement\" type=\"xs:string\"/>\n```\n\nIn this case, `myElement` can occur zero or more times.\n\nIn your second question, it is not clear which XSD element or construct you are referring to. If the question is about groups, and no `maxOccurs` attribute is defined, then the group can occur any number of times including zero times. If it's about complex types or simple types, with no `maxOccurs` defined, the answer is the same.\n\nXML Schema provides flexibility in specifying element occurrences, but it's essential to explicitly define the constraints when needed. In practice, it is common to see a consistent use of `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs` attributes to clearly define the expected cardinalities for each element.", "prediction_3": "According to the XML Schema Specification (second edition, W3C Recommendation, 2001-10-18), the absence of a `maxOccurs` restriction in an element or complex type definition translates to an unbounded occurrence, i.e., the cardinality is [0..unbounded]. An example from the specification:\n\n```xml\n<xs:element name=\"children\" type=\"ChildType\"/>\n\n<xs:complexType name=\"ParentType\">\n  <xs:sequence>\n    <xs:element ref=\"children\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"/>\n  </xs:sequence>\n</xs:complexType>\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `children` element has no `maxOccurs` constraint defined. Thus, when a `ParentType` element is instantiated, it can contain zero or more `children` elements.\n\nRegarding your second question, when an element or complex type definition has [minOccurs=\"0\"] and implicitly an unbounded [maxOccurs], the total cardinality is defined as [0..unbounded].\n\nFor a more explicit cardinality of [0..2] or [1..2], you should define both `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs`. Here's an example:\n\n```xml\n<xs:element name=\"children\" type=\"ChildType\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"2\"/>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `children` element can occur zero or exactly two times.", "prediction_4": "The XML Schema specification does provide some default rules for elementcardinality when no explicit cardinality constraints are given. Specifically, an element without a cardinality constraint is considered to have the default value of [1..1], meaning that exactly one occurrence is required.\n\nHowever, for complex types, when an element does not have an explicit minOccurs or maxOccurs value but has a parent element that does have a cardinality constraint, the element's cardinality is determined by the parent's cardinality. For example, if a parent element has a cardinality of [0..unbounded], then any child element without an explicit cardinality constraint will also have a cardinality of [0..unbounded].\n\nRegarding your second question, the uncertainty you express about the cardinality of [0..2] versus [1..2] arises from the use of interchangeable notation in some contexts. The [0..2] notation actually means that an element can occur zero or more times (including once), while [1..2] means that an element must occur at least once and can occur up to two times. When no explicit cardinality constraint is provided, the default is [1..1], so neither [0..2] nor [1..2] is the correct interpretation in the absence of an explicit constraint."}

{"question": "I was fixing my laptop, and as you may know, laptops have a lot of small screws to take out when you are fixing it. One of the screws fell into the floor (the floor has carpet on it), and I was unable to follow the screw with my sight. If I don't follow the screw with my sight when it falls, there is a high chance that I will not see that screw again.\nMy question is: what kind of method, tool or hack can I use to find small screws that falls into the floor?\nI have tried using the tool with a magnet on the tip, that mechanics use to grab wrenches that falls in inaccessible areas, but had no luck finding the screw.", "answer": "This is why you should always have spare screws on hand. Fortunately, there is a way:\n\n## Light Method\nMost screws are silver. Shine a flashlight into the carpet and look for little silvery glints. This may take some time, but you'll probably find it. If your carpet is unnaturally thick...\n\n## Magnet Method\nTake a powerful magnet (like a bar magnet, hardware stores - fridge magnets might work) and run it over the surface where you think the screw is. You should find it. If that still fails...\n\n## Vacuum Method\nTake a good vacuum cleaner. Put a sock over the extending arm, and run it over where you think the screw is. The sock will prevent the screw from being vacuumed up, but it will be stuck to the sock. There will still be enough suction to pick up the screw, even with the sock. If not, get a new vacuum! If that fails...\n\n## Organize your screws\nThere are many useful tools to organize screws. Go to your local RadioShack and get one, or make one out of a magnet for that awesome lifehack feel.\n\n## Stop using carpet!\n[Not a &quot;find your screws&quot; method - a tip about not frying your computer]\nCarpet can cause static discharge, which is very very very bad for a computer (personal experience). Work on a hard floor with an antistatic strap to reduce the chance of frying your PC.", "prediction_0": "If you have already tried using a magnetized tool and have not been able to locate the fallen screw on the carpeted floor, here are some alternative methods you can try:\n\n1. Use a flashlight: Shine a bright flashlight on the carpeted area where you believe the screw fell. The reflected light may help you see the screw more clearly.\n2. Feel for the screw: Get down on your hands and knees and carefully feels the carpet with your fingers. The screw may make a slight clicking or clinking sound as you pass over it, or you may be able to feel its shape or rough edges.\n3. Use a vacuum cleaner: Try vacuuming the area where you think the screw fell. If the screw is small and light, it may be sucked up into the vacuum cleaner.\n4. Use a container and water: Fill a shallow container with water and carefully pour it over the area where you think the screw fell. The screw may sink to the bottom of the container, making it easier to see and retrieve.\n5. Use a powerful magnet: Try using a more powerful magnet than the one you previously used. A neodymium magnet may be strong enough to attract the screw through the carpet.\n6. Ask for help: Enlist the help of a friend or family member to search for the screw with you. Two pairs of eyes and hands may be more effective than one.\n7. Reverse the laptop: If all else fails, you may want to consider reversing the laptop and tapping the bottom of it gently on the floor to see if the screw falls out. Be very careful when doing this, as you don't want to damage the laptop in the process.", "prediction_1": "I understand your concern about losing a small screw while working on your laptop.

Use a magnet: A magnet can be useful for locating small metal objects like screws.Try using a strong magnet or a magnet attached to the end of a long stick or rod to help you reach areas that are hard to reach.\n3. Use tweezers: If you can get close to the area where the screw fell, you can try using tweezers to pick it up. Be sure to inspect the carpet fibers for any debris that may get in the way.\n4. Vacuum the area: If the screw has fallen into a carpeted area, try vacuuming the area thoroughly. The suction power of the vacuum may help you locate the screw or even pick it up.\n5. Use a screwdriver: If you know the general area where the screw fell, you can try using the tip of a screwdriver to feel for the screw. Gently probe the area with the screwdriver tip, feeling for any bumps or ridges that may indicate the presence of a screw.\n6.

Use a powerful magnetic tool: A magnet with a stronger magnetic field than the one you've tried could be more effective in finding the screw. You may be able to borrow or purchase a magnetic pick-up tool specifically designed for this purpose. These tools are commonly used in the automotive industry for retrieving small bolts or screws that have fallen into hard-to-reach areas, and they can work well on carpeted surfaces.\n2.

Manually felt the area: You can try running your hands gently over the area where the screw fell, feeling for any indentations or bumps that might indicate where the screw is located. This method may not be very effective on large, soft carpets, but it could be worth a try on harder carpeting or in areas with less carpet density.\n4. Use a bright flashlight: Shining a bright flashlight onto the carpeted area could help you see any small reflections that might be created by the screw. This method may be more effective in rooms with good lighting conditions and less cluttered floors.\n5. Ask for help: If you're still having trouble finding the screw, you could enlist the help of family members, friends, or neighbors. Another pair of eyes and hands could make all the difference in quickly locating the tiny screw.\n\nRemember to be patient and persistent when searching for a small screw that has fallen onto a carpeted floor.

{"question": "How to wear long coats?", "answer": "A long coat is a nice item to have in any closet, especially for people living in colder climates. There is a variety of styles of long coats as well as ways you can wear them. Make your long coat work for you by finding a style that fits you, dressing it down for casual daily wear, or adding it on top of a dressy outfit for a formal occasion.\n\n## Choose the right coat\n\n1. Try a fit-and-flare coat for the illusion of a thinner waist. For a long coat that hides a thick waist, try a fit-and-flare style. These coats fit tighter around the waist and then flare out at the hips. The tops are often double-breasted, and there are strategically placed seams on them to create a thinner look. Solid black and vertical stripes also make people look thinner. Experiment with these colors if you\u2019re concerned about making your waist look thinner.\n2. Balance out wide hips with a voluminous collar on your coat. If you\u2019d like to create the illusion of smaller hips, choose a coat that has a large collar such as a shawl collar or large faux-fur collar. The volume of the collar will draw attention away from the bottom half of your coat.\n3. Add curves to a narrow frame with a belted coat. Belts add dimension to long, straight coats. Look for a long coat with a thick wrap-around belt if you\u2019d like to make your thin frame look curvier. Subtle pleats around the waist also help to add curves. Colors and patterns that add dimension for a thin person include light colors and plaid.\n4. Hide a rounder belly with a full-length men\u2019s coat. Most younger men today wear knee-length long coats, but that length looks best on trim men who can wear a more form-fitting coat. Full-length coats go past the knee to the mid-calf, and are nice for disguising a heavier figure. Full-length coats are also considerably warmer, so they are ideal for cold climates.\n5. Go with a double-breasted knee-length coat if you\u2019re petite. Long coats can easily swallow up a short person. A way to solve this is to keep the coat around knee-length or just past your knees. Double-breasted coats with a large envelope collar keep a proportioned look to a longer coat worn on a petite person. If you are of an average or taller height, you can easily pull off full-length coats that go past the knee to your mid-calf or below.\n6. Do the hug test to make sure the coat isn\u2019t too small. It\u2019s easy to buy a long coat that\u2019s too small because the length of the coat may make you think it fits you. To check, try the coat on and wrap your arms around yourself, trying to touch the opposite shoulder with each hand. If the coat feels really tight in the shoulders or elbows, you should go with the next size up. You can also check the sleeve length by holding your arms straight out in front of you. If the sleeves go up 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) past your wrists, you probably need the next size up. The sleeve end should fall within 1 in (2.5 cm) of you wrist when your arms are up, and go almost to your knuckles when they are down.\n7. Check that the shoulder seams line up with your shoulders. On a properly fitting coat, the shoulder seams should line up with your shoulders. If they go down near your biceps, the coat is either too big or it is supposed to have an oversized shape to it. Either try on the next size down, or confirm that oversized is the style that you\u2019re going for. Consider getting a coat tailored for you if cannot find a coat that fits correctly across your chest and shoulders as well as the length of your arms.\n8. Choose a wool coat for the longest winter wear. Long coats come in a variety of fabrics, but if you\u2019re planning to wear your coat for a long time during the winter, invest in 100% wool or a wool-cashmere blend. Coats made with all cashmere tend to show wear much faster. If you intend to wear your jacket in fall, spring, or summer weather, you have more options for fabric, including cotton and twill.\n\n\n## Wear a long coat casually\n\n1. Wear a black coat with ripped jeans and sneakers for a go-anywhere look. Long black coats are versatile because they can be casual or formal. Pair yours with ripped blue or black skinny jeans, a fitted graphic T-shirt, and your favorite sneakers. Plain white sneakers are a popular classic with this look, but you can experiment with vintage, black and white, or skate style sneakers to individualize the style.\n2. Pair baggy trousers with an oversized maxi coat and sunglasses for comfort. If you\u2019re looking to stay both comfortable and warm this winter, wear baggy black trousers rolled at the ankles with a cozy V-neck shirt under any color oversized maxi coat. Grey is a popular coat color for this look, but you can try navy or even a patterned coat. Sunglasses pull off the chic casual style of this look. Go with plain black glasses of any shape that you like. Try this look with either white sneakers or laced ankle boots.\n3. Wear a floor length coat with flared denim as an elegant-casual crossover. Floor-length coats take the classic long coat a few steps further; you can pull off a very cute, elegant casual look by pairing one with flared denim jeans. Wear this with an oversized knit sweater and dressy boots to complete the look. Add large sunglasses and a scarf to this look for extra flare.\n4. Try a long camel coat with a scarf for an intellectual touch. Long camel coats have an automatically sophisticated feel to them and are popular in the fall. Pair yours with black skinny jeans and a wide oversized scarf to look ready to hit the books. Complete this look with crisp white low-cut sneakers, a sweater, and pair of glasses.\n5. Add a beanie to any long coat for a fun casual look. Take the seriousness out of a long coat by adding a slouchy beanie on your head. Wear jeans or sweatpants, a long-sleeved T-shirt, and a pair of ankle boots or sneakers to finish off this casual style.\n6. Make an extra-long coat punk with colorful lace-up ankle boots. To achieve an 80s punk-inspired look, wear black skinny jeans and a button-down shirt with combat style boots under a mid-calf coat. To really finish off this look, add a few 1 inch (2.5 cm) band pins, or badges, to the lapels of your coat. Wear a pair of black sunglasses with this look to give it an extra rock-star vibe.\n7. Pair a pale maxi coat with cropped denim and a white T-shirt in the spring. Long coats aren\u2019t just for fall and winter; you can pair lighter long jackets with a variety of spring looks as well. Try a pale blue, pink, or white long coat with light blue cropped jeans or shorts. Add a colorful fitted T-shirt and sandals to complete the look. Instead of denim, wear a short spring sundress and casual sandals under your light long coat for cute but informal effect.\n\n\n## Dress up with a long coat\n\n1. Wear a long coat over black cigarette pants and heels for a sophisticated look. A long coat that\u2019s camel, grey, navy, red, or patterned looks great over top of black cigarette pants and heels. Wear a black blouse with this outfit, and try to match your heels with the coat for the best effect. For example, a camel coat with this outfit looks elegant with a pair of shiny nude heels.\n2. Try a long faux-fur coat with strappy heels for an elegant edge. No need to spend lots of money on real fur \u2013 there are many nice faux fur options out there for coats. Choose a black or white faux-fur coat and pair it with strappy heels, a short or mid-length skirt, or capris pants for an elegant look. Either chunky or stiletto heels work for this look; just make sure they are high and strappy.\n3. Pair leather leggings and heels with an extra-long black coat for serious glam. Find yourself a pair of black faux leather leggings and combine them with black heels of your choice for a glamourous look. Wear a simple white blouse underneath to finish off this look. Add a pair of classic large black sunglasses to this look for some extra glam.\n4. Wear a long unbuttoned coat over a cocktail dress for a night out. Go with a plain button-down black coat over a dark colored dress in the winter, or pair a lightweight camel trench coat over a light-colored or floral dress in the summer. Add heels to match your dress and jewelry to be ready for any formal occasion.\n5. Wear a Paletot or Guards\u2019 coat for versatility. The Paletot and Guards\u2019 coat styles are classic business coats for men that can be worn for any formal occasion. They are double-breasted with 2 rows of 6 buttons and peaked lapels. Navy blue or charcoal colors of this coat can be worn to a business meeting, over a tuxedo, or to a funeral.\n6. Pair a fitted long coat with dress trousers and loafers for any formal occasion. Dress trousers and shiny loafers, paired with a tucked button-down shirt, look sharp under any fitted long coat. Match your trousers to the coat and choose a dark colored shirt in the winter, or a lighter colored shirt in the summer. Add a tie that compliments your shirt to make this look extra formal.\n", "prediction_0": "Wearing a long coat can be both stylish and functional, but it may require some consideration to ensure a flattering and comfortable fit. Here are some tips on how to wear long coats:\n\n1. Choose the right size: Make sure the coat is the right size for you. The shoulders should fit comfortably without being too tight or too loose. The length of the coat should be long enough to cover your hips and thighs, but not so long that it drags on the ground.\n2. Layer appropriately: Wear long coats over warm and comfortable clothing.

Use belts or sashes to cinch the waist and create a more flattering silhouette.\n6.

{"question": "How to handle a dramatic sister in law?", "answer": "## Tone down the drama queen\n\n1. Realize that you may be dealing with a drama queen. The dynamics of a sister-in-law (S-I-L) are complex at the best of times but no more so if she has spent much of her life causing her immediate family to run to her beck and call. The drama queen thrives off drama and having everyone pay attention to her as a result. Sit back at your next family occasion and simply watch. Notice how she interacts with her family members, and how they in turn react back. If you witness a lot of step-toeing around her and acquiescing to her, she is clearly used to getting her own way. Consider what happens when she raises a drama-filled topic. Do other family members rush to agree with her about how \"outrageous\" the price of child care/electricity/shampoo/dog grooming/car maintenance/etc. is? Do they confirm her quibbles as quickly as possible, thereby engendering even more complaints? This shows that they enable her complaint-filled view of the world and sadly, have long been used to pandering to it. You can't change them but you can set a new role model by not complaining yourself. Notice what happens when you disagree with her. Does she pout, throw an adult-style tantrum or try and put you down? While it's important to stand your ground on things that matter to you, if she does react childishly, you'll need to learn how to manage this carefully. Learn not so much to disagree as to fail to agree\u2013\u2013there is a fine line but it's about acknowledging her underlying need (notice me, care about me, help me, etc.) without buying into her view of the world.\n2. Do not get involved with the drama. Your S-I-L can let off steam, vent away and curse all she wants but there is no need to join the negativity. Avoid taking any of what is said personally\u2013\u2013the crazier the reactions and actions, the more your S-I-L is grasping at straws to try and provoke you and restore the limelight back onto her. Let her have the limelight in her own home but don't hang around to be vented upon. If it gets really bad, simply announce that you will come back when she is feeling calmer and leave. Equally, if it's happening in your own home, tell it's time to leave. (You can even make up a fake appointment or an early bedtime if you really need a polite excuse.)\n\n\n## Deal with your hot button\n\n1. Look to yourself first. It can be hard when to do this when someone else pushes your buttons. But it is important because it is your reaction that defines whether or not she feels she can keep going in the same direction with you. Some of the things to consider include:\n\t* Stay silent and there's a risk she just thinks you're dumb, awed by her or chewed up with resentment. Take your pick, she's probably happy to think you're feeling all three. And she'll use your silence to keep putting across her point of view at the expense of yours. If you're grinning and bearing it, you're likely turning into a doormat. Argue and she probably thinks her brother/sister has married an angry, resentful and bitter so-and-so who hates her and will do anything to come between her and her brother/sister. You may feel as if you're defending yourself but to her, it's about you not caring what she thinks and possibly even about putting her down. This doesn't mean there isn't room for disagreement; it just means that the manner in which you realign her understanding must be done with care.\n2. Create boundaries. State the facts about matters that she pressures you about, firmly but politely, and avoid being emotional into the bargain. If you state things simply, stick to the facts and avoid making it into an issue about her, she has few places to run. Be aware that she may continue to resent you for speaking your mind in an assertive and self-effective way but this shouldn't stop you from clarifying your position. Ultimately, she has to respect someone who doesn't argue, lose their temper or bite their tongue but instead makes it absolutely clear where the boundaries exist. And even if she doesn't everyone else will plainly see that you are the cooler head in the room. For example, let's say your daughter Sheila has been running outside and has fallen over. Your S-I-L insists that she needs to see a doctor or something terrible might happen. You are quite sure nothing of the sort will occur and you know you're a good parent but S-I-L keeps badgering you, upping the intensity of all the bad things that will happen if you fail to follow her advice. Offer your S-I-L a calmly spoken \"That's very kind of you to notice that Sheila has a bruised knee but I am thoroughly satisfied that Sheila is going to be all right; this happens all the time and is a part of the way she learns to cope with the great outdoors. She does not need to see the doctor.\" And that's the end of it, no need to enter into any further discussion. If S-I-L keeps trying, smile and change the subject; refuse to re-engage on the matter.\n\n\n## You and your spouse\n\n1. Talk to your spouse about your feelings. Avoid name-calling, insulting or insinuating anything about your sister-in-law. Instead, explain how you feel when the proverbial dung hits the fan whenever you're in her presence. Your spouse cannot fault your feelings, so be clear and thoughtful in stating them. This puts your spouse on notice that you've recognized the behavior of your S-I-L for what it is and that you have chosen to no longer accept being at the receiving end of it. For example, \"Georgia, when your sister talks a lot about how hard it is to fund her children's private schooling, I feel claustrophobic because she doesn't know when to stop discussing it. Given that we can barely afford our mortgage, I feel a little distressed at this kind of talk all night. I'd like to stop putting myself in this position from now on by simply acknowledging her problem but not letting her continue discussing it all night and I'd like you to help me do this by finding other subjects to talk about that don't involve money. Do you think that this is something you can get on board with? \".\n2. Ask your spouse to think carefully about the way in which he or she relays information about family issues. Tell your spouse that you love to hear about how your sister-in-law is doing but that you don't appreciate hearing about the embellished drama that often comes with it. Help your spouse to recognize what you consider to be \"drama\" from what you consider to be \"real news\" and in time, both of you will learn to speak about family matters in a less dramatic and more emotionally healthy way. Remind your spouse gently whenever you feel that your S-I-L's drama is being repeated in your house. You could even have a special signal rather than having to spell it out each time. Place a ban on gossip at home (or anywhere). Remind one another whenever it veers anywhere near close to gossip and shut it down. It doesn't matter if you feel you are being gossiped about; you're the bigger person for not engaging in the same behavior.\n\n\n## Cop with your s-i-l's call and message\n\n1. Avoid answering what isn't worthy of a response. Don't respond to any text messages that do not directly relate to a family get-together, positive messages or something else perfectly normal. If you are getting texts that spell out her outrage about things that have happened to her, her annoyance at something you've apparently done or to send you gossip about family or friends, let it slide and leave her wondering. If you feel angry and want to send back a retort, reprimand or justification straight away, don't do it. Treat your anger or irritation as a warning sign to sleep on the matter. Furious texting or messaging can only end in more angst on both sides.\n2. Keep social media networking to a minimum with your sister-in-law if she sets off your buttons. If your S-I-L is truly a pain and a bit of a drama queen, it's possible that her social networking reflects her attention-seeking ways. You can be all too easily drawn into a web of her anger and drama venting if you can see her Facebook updates or her latest tweets. If she friends you, you can do one of several things. One, simply ignore the request. When she asks you about it, tell her that you don't use social media much to exchange important things (or at all); or\n\t* Two, reply to her with a \"Thanks but no thanks, I am not accepting new requests at the moment due to busyness/privacy/overloading, etc.\" You might also add something like, \"Besides, we see each other often and I prefer we talk face-to-face\"; or\n\t* Three, turn all of your settings to private so that she can't see who you are friends with. Either say nothing or tell her either that you stopped using social media or that you only have a tight knit circle of followers and don't wish to extend it at the moment. If you say you didn't receive any request, she'll only resend it, but it might buy enough time to throw her off the whole idea if you offer to \"look into it\" but let the \"looking into it\" drag on and refuse to raise the matter again); or\n\t* Four, offer her a more neutral alternative. Offer to friend her on Pinterest and focus solely on a shared craft or cooking board. Nothing racy or mean spirited, of course. Try to avoid using the terminology of \"friends\" when discussing any refusal to accept her request. Unfortunately, the usage of this term by social media sites has caused many people to take it at face value; many people are simply followers or fans, not friends. She might feel devalued if you make any suggestion that she is being rejected as a \"friend\". If she is already a follower of one or more of your networking sites, you might consider blocking her and turning your pages private on some sites. Most probably you will need to explain what has happened (with a sound excuse); if she's a drama queen, she'll not only notice but she'll take offense too.\n3. Take care if you do soldier on and try to be her friend online and/or through the phone. If she acts abusively, it is recommended that you keep records to show your spouse and other family members if needed. Save messages, emails, voice-mails, etc. Some drama queens like to \"attack\" when nobody else can see, thinking you won't have the courage to out them. This isn't about deliberately looking for dirt but it is a way of protecting yourself if anything should get out of hand. However, this is truly the stuff of last resort\u2013\u2013if you handle yourself deftly in public situations around your S-I-L, everyone will know for real who is behaving and who is stirring the pot.\n\n\n## A kinder future together\n\n1. Get on with your lives together. You married your spouse, not your family. While his or her family members are part of the package, they are not a part of your intimacy and they do not share the same journey with the two of you. If you make it very obvious that you're not bothered by jealousy, insinuations, rumors or gossip, it will soon become clear to your S-I-L that her barbs, attitude and meanness aren't pricking you in the way that they used to. Eventually, it ceases to be profitable or enjoyable for her to keep bothering and most likely she'll begrudgingly go and find someone else to taunt and hassle. Spend less time around your S-I-L. In what ways are you putting yourself in her pathway? While it may feel like you have to put up with her, you can find ways to reduce the time spent together. For example, ask other family members to meet you at different times than when she is around, more often than not. Don't always do this, or she will have a legitimate cause for complaining, but time spent with other family members shouldn't always involve her presence. If you live far away and have to visit once a year, stay in your own accommodation to give yourself respite. Take walks, get outside and don't overstay any welcome when it comes to drawn-out family events that press your buttons. Families know the pressure points better than anyone and unfortunately, some like to press them. At such events, your S-I-L probably has alliances that she can set in train to be even more effective, so the less time spent near such complaint-prone cliques, the better.\n2. Listen for real. When you are around your S-I-L, try active listening and acknowledgment in place of letting your fog of self-defensiveness take control. When she gets on top of her complaining mountain, instead of trying to topple her off with \"if you think that's bad, you should live in my shoes\" replies, actually focus on her and try to discern what is really driving her jibes, whining and gossip. By not making this about you, you may be truly surprised at what you unearth.As for responding to her, acknowledge her pain with neutral comments like: \"I'm sorry you have had to go through that to pay an electricity bill. It must be hard having four kids chewing through the power each month.\" Don't offer advice, don't offer how you would deal with it and don't ever offer to pay or pave the way to see her problem resolved. She owns it, you simply acknowledge it.\n3. Be compassionate. If your S-I-L has been a pain more than once and has even done things to show you up or drag you down, the chances are that she will try to do it again, even when you don't bite. But if you're ready for it and if you're understanding as to where she is coming from (insecurity, loneliness, feeling left out, needing to be in control, etc. ), you can be compassionate about her actions and detach yourself from her drama.

{"question": "What gives rise to musical ability, biologically speaking?", "answer": "Based on a 2015 article from Nature Scientific Reports, many genes are \"turned on\" when performing a complex musical piece.\nThese genes are related to muscle control, neural flexibility and growth, and even to the pleasure center in the brain.\nInterestingly, variants of about a third of these genes were also previously identified as relating to song production and perception in songbirds.", "prediction_0": "Musical ability, like many other complex traits, is believed to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The exact biological mechanisms that give rise to musical ability are not yet fully understood, but research suggests that several brain areas and neural pathways are involved.\n\nOne theory is that musical ability is related to the development and function of the auditory system and areas of the brain that process music, such as the temporal lobe and the limbic system, which is involved in emotions and memory. Studies have shown that musicians have structural and functional differences in these areas compared to non-musicians.\n\nFor example, some studies have found that musicians have larger planum temporale, a region of the temporal lobe that is thought to be involved in tonal language and music processing, than non-musicians. Other studies have found differences in connectivity and activation patterns in the brains of musicians compared to non-musicians when they listen to or perform music.\n\nGenetics also plays a role in musical ability. Twin studies have suggested that there is a heritability component to musical ability, with genetic factors accounting for up to 50% of the variation in musical aptitude. Some research has identified specific genes that are associated with musical ability, such as those involved in auditory processing, motor coordination, and temporal lobe function.\n\nIt's important to note that musical ability is a complex trait that involves many different skills, including pitch perception, rhythm processing, melodic memory, motor coordination, and expressiveness. More research is needed to fully understand the biological underpinnings of these various aspects of musical ability.", "prediction_1": "Musical ability, like many other complex human traits, is thought to arise from a combination of both genetic and environmental factors. From a biological perspective, several structures and regions in the brain have been identified as playing a role in processing and producing music.\n\nOne of the most significant structures is the auditory system, including the cochlea and the auditory cortex. The cochlea is responsible for converting sound waves into electrical signals that can be processed by the brain. The auditory cortex, located in the temporal lobe, is where sounds are recognized and identified.\n\nAdditionally, there are specific areas in the brain that are involved in processing musical information, such as the planum temporale and the corpus callosum. The planum temporale is larger in individuals with musical training or abilities, suggesting a possible role in musical perception and production. The corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres of the brain, is also thought to play a role in musical ability as it facilitates communication between the left and right hemispheres, which are involved in different aspects of musical processing.\n\nGenetically, there have been several studies that have identified genes associated with musical ability. For example, the genes involved in the development and function of the auditory system and in the production of certain neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, have been implicated in musical ability. However, it is important to note that the relationship between genetics and musical ability is complex, and many genes with small effects may contribute to the trait.\n\nEnvironmental factors, such as early musical training and experience, can also play a significant role in the development of musical ability. For example, children who receive musical training at a young age have been shown to have better fine motor skills, language development, and academic achievement, as well as enhanced auditory processing abilities and musical skill development. Additionally, engagement in musical activities, such as playing an instrument or singing, can lead to changes in brain structure and function, further contributing to musical ability.\n\nOverall, musical ability appears to arise from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, with contributions from both the auditory system and other regions of the brain. Further research is needed to fully understand the underlying biological mechanisms underlying musical ability and how they interact with environmental factors.", "prediction_2": "Musical ability, like many other complex traits, is believed to be the result of a complex interplay between both genetic and environmental factors. There are several biological mechanisms that have been implicated in musical ability:\n\n1. Auditory system: Having a finely tuned auditory system is essential for recognizing and producing musical sounds. Studies have shown that people with perfect pitch, the ability to identify musical notes by tone alone, have differences in the structure and function of certain areas of their auditory system.\n2. Motor system: Musical ability requires the ability to coordinate movements of various muscle groups to produce sound on a musical instrument or to sing in tune. Evidence suggests that musicians have greater motor control and coordination than non-musicians.\n3. Neurological factors: Several areas of the brain are involved in musical processing and production. For example, the planum temporale, a region of the brain that plays a role in processing sound sequences, has been found to be larger in musicians than in non-musicians.\n4. Genetic factors: Twin studies have shown that there is a genetic component to musical ability. For example, identical twins are more likely to have similar musical preferences and abilities than fraternal twins. Some studies have identified specific genes that may be involved in musical ability, but more research is needed in this area.\n5. Environmental factors: Exposure to music and musical training are important factors in the development of musical ability. Children who receive musical training at an early age tend to have better musical abilities than those who do not receive such training.\n\nOverall, the exact causes of musical ability are not yet fully understood, and it is likely that a combination of genetic and environmental factors contributes to individual differences in musical ability.", "prediction_3": "Musical ability, like many other human traits, is believed to result from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. While there is ongoing research in this area, several key areas of the brain and specific genes have been identified as potentially involved in musical abilities. Here are some of the leading theories:\n\n1. Genetic Factors: Studies have indicated that musical ability can run in families, suggesting a genetic component. While no single \"music gene\" has been identified, several genes have been linked to various aspects of musicality, such as the ability to discriminate pitches (connexin 32), rhythm and timing (MTTMs and CACNA1G), and language processing (FOXP2).\n\n2. Neural Structures: Several brain structures are involved in processing and producing music. The most well-known are the auditory cortex (responsible for processing sounds and melodies), the motor cortex and basal ganglia (involved in producing motor responses, like playing an instrument), and the limbic system (involved in emotion and memory).\n\n3. Early Experience: Environmental factors, particularly early experiences, can greatly influence musical ability. Studies have shown that children who receive music training at a young age, especially before the age of 7, can experience enhanced neural and behavioral development in regions related to language, memory, and attention. This effect has been referred to as the \"critical period\" for musical development.\n\n4. Training and Practice: Musical ability can also be enhanced through dedicated practice and training, as shown by neuroplastic changes in the brain, particularly in regions involved in processing and producing music.\n\nIn summary, musical ability is likely the result of a combination of genetic, neural, and environmental factors, with genetics establishing a predisposition, and environmental factors, including early experience and training, shaping the development of musical skills.", "prediction_4": "Musical ability, like many other human skills, is believed to result from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors.

The most well-known is the auditory cortex, which is involved in the perception of sound. However, other areas such as the motor cortex, basal ganglia, and limbic system are also involved in various aspects of music production and perception.\n\nSome researchers have suggested that the human brain is hardwired for music, as it has been found that infants show preferences for certain musical features, such as a regular beat and consonant harmonies, even before they have formal musical training. This has led some to propose that music is a universal human feature, with evolutionary significance.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that musical ability is not determined solely by genetics. Environmental factors, such as access to musical education and practice, can have a profound impact on musical development. For instance, a study published in the journal Nature Genetics in 2019 found that children who received musical training showed greater gray matter density in the auditory cortex compared to those who did not receive musical training.\n\nOverall, musical ability is the result of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, and researchers are continuing to explore the underlying biological and psychological mechanisms."}
{"question": "When configuring cron to run a command every other day using the \"Day of Month\" field, like so: \n```1 22 */2 * * COMMAND\n```\nit runs every time the day of month is odd: 1,3,5,7,9 and so on.\nHow can I configure cron to run on days of month that are even like 2,6,8,10 and so on (without specifying it literally, which is problematic as every month has a different number of days in the month)?", "answer": "The syntax you tried is actually ambiguous. Depending on how many days are in the month, some months it will run on odd days and some on even. This is because the way it is calculated takes the total number of possibilities and divides them up. You can override this strage-ish behavior by manually specifying the day range and using either an odd or even number of days. Since even day scripts would never run on the 31st day of longer months, you don't lose anything using 30 days as the base for even-days, and by specifying specifically to divide it up as if there were 31 days you can force odd-day execution.\n\nThe syntax would look like this:\n```# Will only run on odd days:\n0 0 1-31/2 * * command\n# Will only run on even days:\n0 0 2-30/2 * * command\n```\n\nYour concern about months not having the same number of days is not important here because no months have MORE days than this, and for poor February, the date range just won't ever match the last day or two, but it will do no harm having it listed.\n\nThe only 'gotcha' for this approach is that if you are on an odd day cycle, following months with 31 days your command will also run on the first of the month. Likewise if you are forcing an even cycle, each leap year will cause one three-day cycle at the end of February. You cannot really get around the fact that any regular pattern of \"every other day\" is not always going to fall on even or odd days in every month and any way you force this you will either have an extra run or be missing a run between months with mismatched day counts.", "prediction_0": "To configure cron to run a command on even days of the month for all months, you can use the modulo operator (%).

Here's the expression:\n\n```\n0 22 [!(3|5)|((8|10|12)|(1|3|5|7|11))\\ 2] COMMAND\n```\n\nThis expression does the following:\n\n- `0 22` - Run every day at 22:00 (10:00 PM).\n- `[!(3|5)|((8|10|12)|(1|3|5|7|11))\\ 2]` - Negate a list of conditions:\n  - `!(3|5)` - The day is not a multiple of 3 or 5.\n  - `|` - Or.\n  - `((8|10|12)|(1|3|5|7|11))\\ 2` - The day is a multiple of 2, but not of 3, 5, or is in the list of months with special numbering (January, March, May, July, August, and October).\n\nMake sure to save and test the cron job as usual.", "prediction_2": "To configure cron to run a command every other day when the day of the month is even, you can use the following expression:\n\n```0 22 [1-31]/*2* * COMMAND\n```\n\nThis expression will match any day of the month where the day number is even. Let me explain how it works:\n\n- `[1-31]` matches any number between 1 and 31.\n- `/*2*` matches every second day, the asterisk is for any value and the two slashes represent a repetition of the previous field (in this case the day of the month).\n\nSo, the expression `[1-31]/*2*` matches every even day of the month, and the rest of the line (minutes, hours, weeks, and months) are left as is for your command to run at 10:22 PM.\n\nIt's worth noting that this method assumes that you want the command to run every other day throughout the year. If you only want it to run every other day with an even number, specific to certain months (for example, February), you would need to list out those months using the month names or numbers. In such a case, it would be more efficient to use a script that checks if the command should be executed or not, based on the current month and day of the month. This approach is more flexible and can help avoid potential issues with cron's limited syntax.", "prediction_3": "Unfortunately, cron does not support a direct way to specify that a job should run on even days of the month without listing them out explicitly.

Create a file named `even_days` with the following content:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nday=`date +%d`\nif [ $(($day % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then\n  # Your command goes here, for example:\n  COMMAND\nfi\n```\n\nReplace `COMMAND` with the command you want to run.\n\n2.

{"question": "How to physically flirt with a girl?", "answer": "Flirting builds attraction and tension, but it has to be done in the right way. Done in the wrong way, the girl you like might scurry off and never look back. Like all flirting, body language attraction is a fun process, but don\u2019t rush it. Slowly position yourself so that you can flirt with your crush with confidence, and most importantly, have fun with it.\n\n## Get her to warm up to you\n\n1. Get to know her. Think about what she likes and her interests. Ask her if you're not sure. Understanding her interests helps you find common ground so that you have a reason to see and talk to her, which brings you one step closer to physically flirting with her. As you get to know her, be kind and considerate or she might not let you get much closer. Go slow. If you walk up and put your arm around a girl without knowing her well or flirting first, she might get offended and think you\u2019re too forward. Flirting gradually over a period of time -- even if it is a short period of time -- is the best way to get a girl to go out with you.\n2. Compliment her. Compliments give you the ability to let her warm up to you so that you can get close to her physically. When you talk to her, give her a compliment that sounds genuine. Otherwise, she might think you\u2019re trying to \"game\" her. Girls like compliments as long as it doesn\u2019t sound like a pick-up line. Superficial compliments might make her shut down and not want to talk to you. Give compliments that are unique to her and be specific. For instance, compliment her cute ears, freckles or eyes. Remember that a lot of girls -- even the pretty ones -- are very insecure. When you try to compliment her, she might not take you seriously because she thinks you are joking. So, reassure her that you\u2019re not. Don\u2019t neg her or give her a backhanded compliment. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty for a brunette\u201d is not a compliment. Never make her the object of a joke, and if people say something rude -- even if they're teasing -- tell them to stop. Then, quickly glance at her. If her eyes get bigger or if she smiles slightly, then she is impressed and thankful.\n3. Make eye contact when you speak to her. It not only lets her know that you\u2019re listening, but it also gives her the feeling that she is worth your undivided attention. Eye contact creates tension and attraction. Try to hold her gaze for a while without breaking it -- even if there are distractions around. Ignore them. She will be impressed that you didn\u2019t let the chaos around you distract you from her. Then, she\u2019ll be more likely to open up to you.\n4. Mimic her body language. If she leans forward, you lean forward. If she steps to the side, you step to the side. Mimicking her body language is a subtle way of letting her know that you are into her. Even if she is consciously unaware of this, subconsciously she may start to pick up the signal. Watch her body language as well to see if she mimics you. Mimicry is a sign that she is warming up to you even if she is not quite ready for flirtatious touching just yet.\n5. Give her attention in a crowd. Sometimes girls can feel lost when they are standing in a large crowd or even if she is standing amongst friends -- especially if her friends are attractive. She might think that some of her friends get more attention than she does because they are prettier or more outgoing, which means it can be difficult for her to feel like she is being seen and heard. So, make her feel like she is standing out from the others by giving her more attention. When she speaks, pay special attention. Make a point to talk to her directly instead of speaking to others. When the group is making a decision about where to go or what to do, ask her what she thinks the group should do.\n6. Call her just to talk. Make sure that she knows that you really want to get to know her better. Calling her just to chat -- especially since texting is far more popular -- lets her know that you really are interested in getting to know her better. Chat about her interests or current events. Or, just give her a hello and a short chat to let her know you\u2019re thinking about her. You don\u2019t need to be some extreme version of yourself that doesn\u2019t really exist. Just be \u201cnormal.\"\n7. Bring her something. Nothing major. It can be something small like a snack item that you see her eating often. Make sure that you come off like an observant person and not a creepy stalker who likes to watch her. Don't be put off if she refuses your gift. She may not want to immediately accept something from you. She doesn\u2019t want to feel as if she is indebted to you because you gave her something. If you ask a couple of times, she may eventually give in and accept it.\n8. Text her to ask you to meet you somewhere. If she agrees to meet you, don't comment on any other girls or talk about subjects that would make her think you aren't interested-- unless you know she likes those subjects. You don\u2019t want her to think you only like her as a friend. You want to make her feel special, not like just another member of your group\n\n\n## Sneak to touch her\n\n1. Touch her knee against yours. Slowly move your knee toward hers until they touch lightly. Make sure that you touch her knee gently and then linger, so she doesn't think that you are bumping her leg because you need more room for your legs. Flirting by accidental touch helps build attraction because it creates tension. Small touches here and there leaves her wanting more. But remember to keep your eyes open for mutual signals. If it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s enjoying it, stop.\n2. Touch her hand or arm when you laugh. Say something funny, or laugh at her jokes and then laugh. While you\u2019re laughing, gently touch the top of her hand or forearm as if to say \u201c you jokester.\u201d This should look casual and natural. It should look as is if you do this to everyone when you laugh. If you are sitting down when this happens, take this opportunity to casually slide your chair closer to hers.\n3. Tuck her hair behind her ear. This works best if she has a strand of hair out of place or a strand hanging in her face. Gently, tuck the hair behind her ear so that it is out of her face.\n4. Put your hand close to hers. When you are sitting next to her at a table, always place your hand so that it is really close to hers. A finger length apart or a little more is a good distance. To take it a step further, place your hands on hers for just a second as if it is accidental.\n5. Play footsie. If you're sitting at a table/desk across from her, gently put your feet on top of hers. It may seem like playing footsie is a little childish, but it is a way to get a girl\u2019s attention in a playful manner while also letting her know that you\u2019re interested. If she looks under the table and smiles, then she is happy that the person gently kicking her is you.\n\n\n## Flirt with her overtly\n\n1. Hug her. It\u2019s a reason to touch her in a non-sexual way. It\u2019s also a legitimate reason to touch her without seeming too flirty especially if you greet her with a hug. If you do this every time you see her, she will begin to understand that hugging is the way that you greet her.You could possibly get a hug every time you see her. If you want to take it a step further, hug her more frequently. Give her hugs for no reason if you know her fairly well. With time, this may escalate and she might start giving you hugs. However, also keep in mind that some people just don't like hugging. So, it is important to pay attention to her body language and facial expressions. If she doesn't like it, stop; and of course, if she tells you to stop, you should stop immediately.\n2. Play with her hair. Some girls like this. Focus on the hair at the nape of the neck because playing with her hair in this area will probably give her chills -- in a good way. If she is comfortable with you, play with the hair close to her torso or bustline. (Be respectful though.) From there if the girl is still comfortable, take it a little further. With the back of your hand, gently push the hair hanging in front of her shoulders behind her shoulders. (Please don't do this if it looks like the girl worked a long time to style her hair. Even if you are just trying to flirt with her, she will get mad at you for ruining her hair.) If all is well, start to rub her neck like you\u2019re giving her a neck massage.\n3. Put your hands around her waist from behind. If she likes you, she'll most likely lean back on you. Touch her gently so you don't startle her. If you two get really comfortable she might even let you slide your hand down a little lower. Once she\u2019s comfortable with you putting your hands on her waist, grab her and swing her around. Then, she\u2019ll be facing you. Lean in and whisper something in her ear, or just say it outright. You\u2019ll be able to tell if she liked it by the expression on her face. (Beware: Some girls are extremely ticklish and tend to involuntarily squeal or giggle when someone touches their waists).\n4. Push her playfully. When you're walking next to her on a sidewalk or path, gently push her off the path. She'll probably push you back, which will start some playful flirting. Because even childishly pushing each other is a way of flirting. (Don't do this on a busy road though. Someone might get hurt.)\n5. Put your head in her lap. If you're already friends and you're watching a movie, reading, or just talking with friends, go over and lie your head in her lap. Let her play with your hair. If she pushes you off, just laugh. This only works well if you\u2019ve flirted with this girl many times before.\n6. Tickle her. Good areas for tickling are under her ribs or the sides or her stomach. If she likes you, she'll tickle you back -- probably while smiling or laughing. Watch her signals though, if she doesn't like it or if she pulls away, stop. You don\u2019t want to annoy her and ruin any chances of getting close to her again. If she pulls away, revert back to the physical touching that she seems to be comfortable with and do that for a while.\n7. Be respectful. Pay attention to her body language and anything that she says. You don't want to overstep her boundaries. Overt touching should be consensual, and some people are uncomfortable with public displays of affection or being touched at all. Everyone is different, so it is very important to pay attention to her verbal and non-verbal cues. If she says, \"stop\" at any point, then stop. If she looks uncomfortable, stop. She'll perceive you as invading her space and possibly harassing her. Neither are attractive or respectful.\n", "prediction_0": "Flirting is a way to express interest and attraction to someone in a playful and friendly manner.

{"question": "I'd never heard of anycast until a few seconds ago when I read \"What are some cool or useful server/networking tricks?\".\nThe wikipedia \"Anycast\" article on it is quite formal and doesn't really evoke a mental picture of how it would be used.\nCan someone explain in a few informal sentences what \"anycast\" is, how you configure it (just in a general sense), and what its benefits are (what does it make easier)?", "answer": "Anycast is networking technique where the same IP prefix is advertised from multiple locations. The network then decides which location to route a user request to, based on routing protocol costs and possibly the 'health' of the advertising servers.\n\nThere are several benefits to anycast. First, in steady state, users of an anycast service (DNS is an excellent example) will always connect to the 'closest' (from a routing protocol perspective) DNS server. This reduces latency, as well as providing a level of load-balancing (assuming that your consumers are evenly distributed around your network).\nAnother advantage is ease of configuration management. Rather than having to configure different DNS servers depending on where a server/workstation is deployed (Asia, America, Europe), you have one IP address that is configured in every location.\n\nDepending on how anycast is implemented, it can also provide a level of high availability. If the advertisement of the anycast route is conditional on some sort of health check (e.g. a DNS query for a well known domain, in this example), then as soon as a server fails its route can be removed. Once the network reconverges, user requests will be seamlessly forwarded to the next closest instance of DNS, without the need for any manual intervention or reconfiguration.\n\nA final advantage is that of horizontal scaling; if you find that one server is being overly loaded, simply deploy another one in a location that would allow it to take some proportion of the overloaded server's requests. Again, as no client configuration is required, this can be done very quickly.", "prediction_0": "Anycast is a networking technique where multiple servers are assigned the same IP address, but only the closest or most appropriate one is reached based on the network routing. Think of it like having multiple post offices with the same zip code, but your mail gets automatically sorted and delivered to the closest one.\n\nTo configure anycast, you'll need specialized routers and routing policies that can route traffic based on the closest available server.

Improved Performance: Traffic is automatically routed to the nearest server, reducing latency and improving response times for users.\n2. Redundancy: If one server goes down, traffic is automatically rerouted to another available server without requiring any manual intervention.\n3. Scalability: You can easily add more servers to the anycast pool, allowing you to handle growing traffic demand without needing to change IP addresses for your users.\n\nAnycast is commonly used by content delivery networks (CDNs), ISPs, and large websites and applications to improve the performance and reliability of their services.", "prediction_1": "Anycast is a network routing technology that allows multiple servers to share the same IP address.

Amazingly, Mr. Johnson was unharmed.\n\nClue 5:\nUpon investigating the scene, you discovered that the fire was not an accident. The electrical wires in the basement were deliberately cut, creating the perfect opportunity for an arson attack.\n\nQuestion: Who do you suspect set the fire at Mr. Johnson's house?\n\nAnswer: The man you saw yesterday near Mr. Johnson\u2019s house is the most likely suspect. He asked about any odd occurrences at the house, which could have been a ruse to gather information. The suspicious behavior, along with the fact that he swiftly left when you asked why, points towards his involvement in the arson plot.", "prediction_1": "Title: The Case of the Missing Painting\n\nClue 1:\nI.

Upon further investigation, it was discovered that Mrs. Thompson had recently acquired an expensive telescope and had scheduled a private viewing of \"The Starry Night\" for a wealthy collector that very night.\n\nSolution:\nMrs. Thompson, the curator, orchestrated the theft to create a distraction during the private viewing. She sold the painting to the wealthy collector, who was none other than the mysterious footsteps-leaver, Mr. Johnson.

The intruder used the broken window as an entry point, which was inaccessible from the ground due to its height. It is likely that the intruder arrived by car and left the scene using the fresh tire tracks found in the forest. Therefore, it can be concluded that the intruder was someone familiar with the estate's surroundings, possibly someone with prior knowledge of the mansion's layout and security.

{"question": "What are the primary objections Democrats have to a border wall?", "answer": "It's not clear to me that Democrats are opposed to border-wall construction (your one source suggests they are fine with border walls/fences where necessary), so much as they opposed to some of the plans for full-border walls that have been put forth so far.\nRecently, in response to reports that the spending bill would include funding for a border wall, 5 Democratic senators released a letter voicing concerns over the cost, the effectiveness, and the legal issues of constructing it.\n\nWe are also concerned with reports that there may be an effort to include funding for a very expensive new wall along the southern border with Mexico and a \u201cdeportation force.\u201d  According to non-partisan experts, the proposed new border wall could cost as much as $25 million per mile and raises considerable issues that have not been resolved by the Congress or the Department of Homeland Security.  First, many experts believe that such a border wall will not work.  Second, there is real concern that the Administration, put simply, has no plan to build the border wall.  For example, the Administration has not detailed how to 1) use eminent domain and other procedures to acquire land from private landowners and Native American tribes, 2) design the wall, 3) locate the wall, 4) construct the wall, and 5) require Mexico to pay for the wall given the President\u2019s clear and repeated promises that he would force Mexico to do so. Finally, there are objections to the construction of a wall from Democratic and Republican members of Congress that represent border states.  Given these and other concerns, we believe it would be inappropriate to insist on the inclusion of such funding in a must-pass appropriations bill that is needed for the Republican majority in control of the Congress to avert a government shutdown so early in President Trump\u2019s Administration.\n[...]\nSenator Charles Schumer\nSenator Richard Durbin\nSenator Patty Murray\nSenator Debbie Stabenow\nSenator Patrick Leahy\n\nBased on this letter, it appears their main objections to a full border wall are currently the cost-benefit ratio and the legal issues of taking land from Americans to build it on; objections that may not be unique to Democrats.", "prediction_0": "Democrats have raised several objections to the construction of a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Here are some of the primary objections:\n\n1. Cost: Democrats argue that the cost of building a border wall is exorbitant and could be put to better use addressing other issues such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare.\n2. Ineffectiveness: Critics of the border wall claim that it is not an effective solution to the problem of illegal immigration or drug trafficking. They argue that there are already ways for people to cross the border illegally without a wall, and that other measures such as increased border patrol and technology are more effective.\n3. Environmental concerns: Building a border wall could have negative impacts on the environment, including the destruction of habitat for wildlife and the disruption of ecosystems.\n4. Human rights concerns: Some argue that a border wall would violate the human rights of immigrants and asylum seekers by limiting their ability to seek safety and opportunity in the United States.\n5. Symbolism: Democrats and some critics argue that a border wall represents a division between the United States and its neighbors and goes against the values of unity and inclusion.\n6. Legal challenges: There are ongoing legal challenges to the construction of a border wall, including disputes over private property rights and the use of military funds for construction.\n7.

Estimates for the total cost of President Trump's proposed wall range from $21.6 billion to $100 billion or more. Democrats contend that this money could be better spent on other priorities, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.\n\n2. Effectiveness: Democrats argue that a wall would not be an effective solution to the issue of illegal immigration. They point out that there are already significant stretches of border fence in place, and that illegal immigration continues to be a problem. They argue that a more comprehensive approach, including increased border security technologies, improved border patrol, and addressing the root causes of migration, would be more effective.\n\n3. Human rights concerns: Democrats and other critics argue that a wall would violate human rights and harm communities on both sides of the border. They point out that a wall would separate families, disrupt communities, and damage archaeological and cultural sites. They also argue that a wall would create a humanitarian crisis by preventing migrants from seeking asylum and creating dangerous conditions in migration routes.\n\n4. Environment concerns: Democrats and other critics argue that a border wall would harm the environment. They point out that construction of the wall would involve clearing large areas of land, damaging ecosystems, and disrupting wildlife habitats.

They also argue that the use of eminent domain to acquire land for the wall would be a violation of private property rights.\n\n6. Symbolism and division: Democrats and other critics argue that a border wall would symbolize division and hostility towards immigrants and neighbouring countries.

Effectiveness: Democrats question the wall's effectiveness in addressing the issue of illegal immigration. They argue that most illegal border crossings occur in rural areas where a wall would be difficult and costly to build. They also argue that a wall would not address the root causes of illegal immigration, such as poverty and violence in Central America.\n3. Humanitarian concerns: Democrats express concern about the humanitarian implications of a border wall.

They argue that a wall would send a message of mistrust and hostility to Mexico, and damage the important economic and cultural ties that exist between the two countries.\n5.

Inefficiency: Opponents argue that a wall will not be an effective solution to the issue of illegal immigration.

{"question": "How to comfort a dying dog?", "answer": "Although it is a natural part of life, it is never easy saying goodbye to your beloved canine companion. During this stage of life, you will want to make your dog as comfortable as possible. The comfort you provide throughout this potentially frightening situation will make the transition easier for your dog and bring you peace of mind as well.\n\n## Comfort your dog at home\n\n1. Stay patient with your dog. Older dogs commonly begin experiencing joint and muscle problems, and they can become frustrated with their discomfort and impairments. If your dog is grumpy or irritable during the end stages of life, simply do your best to be patient and provide the other comforts you can at home.\n2. Provide a quiet environment. Chaos around the home will only stress both you and your dog as you're trying to spend the final hours of your dog's life together meaningfully and with compassion. Give your dog a quiet environment away from noisy children or other animals in the house. Soft, unobtrusive music can also be calming, or you may also use a nature soundtrack with birdsong and the sounds of running water.\n3. Speak in comforting tones. Reassure your dog that he's not alone and speak in soft comforting tones. Tell him \u201cgood boy\u201d and the other phrases you normally use for positive reinforcement to let him know it's okay. Give him plenty of light pets as well. If you want to make sure you're there for the final moments, then you may choose to sleep next to his bed in a sleeping bag for the final nights.\n4. Put down comfortable bedding. If your dog has a favorite dog bed, put it down for him. Otherwise you can put down some other blankets to help him lay down comfortably. Your dog may also have difficulty regulating his body temperature at the end, so keep some blankets handy to put over him in the event that he shows signs of being cold. Elderly dogs are also prone to pressure sores, so put down extra cushioning for an older dog. On a practical note, he may also have problems with incontinence at the end. Choose a spot you can easily clean and bedding you can wash later. If your dog does have any accidents, then clean them up patiently without scolding him. He can't help it. If your dog gets cold, you can also use a heater in the area to make him more comfortable.\n5. Keep fresh water available. Hydration is still important to keeping your dog comfortable even in the final hours. Provide a bowl of water next to the dog bed, so your dog doesn't have to get up to drink. If your is having trouble rising even to drink, then use a clean dropper to help provide water.\n6. Prepare some of his favorite meal. If your dog has always had a favorite thing to eat, then you should make some of it in case he's hungry. However, it is pretty common for dogs to lose their appetite in the end stages of life, so don't force him to eat if he's not hungry. Solid food may also upset your dog's stomach at the end as certain systems related to digestion begin shutting down. If your dog still shows a willingness to eat but regular food is upsetting his stomach, then try mixing some baby food with water, or you can also try the Hills A/D diet, which is liquid.\n7. See your veterinarian about pain management. If your dog still has enough time and you're worried about pain in the final stages, then you can consult your vet for pain management options for the final days. Signs that your dog might be in pain include excessive panting or gasping for breath or reluctance to move.\n8. Hug your dog one final time. Once your dog passes, give him one final hug and say goodbye. It's a very painful moment, so remember that it's perfectly okay to cry, but also remember the good times you had with your pet and that he passed in a comfortable, loving environment with you doing everything you could. Be aware that some dogs seem to \"move\" or \"take a breath\" after passing away. As their nervous system shuts down, sometimes muscles in the body or lungs can spasm and look like a sign of life. It's also common for dogs to pass with their eyes open. You can close them if you want as you say your final goodbye, or you can pull one of the blankets over his head.\n9. Take care of yourself. Once your pet has passed, know that you did everything you could and worry about taking care of yourself. Seek comfort in other loved ones who understand the loss. You can also light candles or say a small prayer for your pet if it feels right and helps. The ASPCA also has a hotline you can call to talk to someone who understands the difficulty of losing a pet. You can reach this hotline at 1-877-GRIEF-10.\n10. Handle your pet's remains. Though it's unpleasant, you do have to do something with your pet's remains once he passes. Many people choose to cremate pets or bury them whether in a pet cemetery or closer to home. Many services are available to help you deal with the remains to make the process easier on you. Look online or ask your vet for services in your area that will help with the option of your choosing.\n\n\n## Comfort your dog at the vet\n\n1. Consult a professional about euthanasia. The ASPCA has a specific hotline for those dealing with the difficult decision of euthanizing a pet. The line gives you someone to talk to who will understand your grief throughout the process, as well as information about your dog's quality of life at this stage and whether or not euthanasia may be the most humane option. You can reach the ASPCA hotline at 1-877-GRIEF-10.\n2. Make the appointment. Though it hurts to do and it always feels too soon, you'll have to make an appointment for the vet to euthanize him when you know your dog is at the end of life. Your vet is likely to suggest this option if your dog's condition has significantly deteriorated and the vet believes the dog is in pain.\n3. Bring some of your dog's favorite items. You'll want to surround your dog with a few of his favorite things at the end. A favorite blanket and a soft toy are very common items that you may choose to bring with to help comfort him as he passes. Favorite blankets or a dog bed will also be much more comfortable for your dog than the exam table, especially if he's already in discomfort.\n4. Sign any forms at the vet. When you sign in for the appointment, you'll also have a few forms to fill out, including a consent form signaling that you know what is about to happen. While filling out forms is the last thing you want to focus on, it is a necessary part of the process.\n5. Ask about a sedative beforehand. If your dog is experiencing any pain or discomfort from a medical condition, ask the veterinarian about giving him a sedative. This will make your dog more comfortable, and it will give you the peace of mind later knowing that your dog passed without any pain.\n6. Pet your dog with gentle, loving strokes. Once you've been taken back to the private room and placed your dog down on his blankets with any other items, focus all your energy on spending quality final moments with him. The veterinarian will have to finish setting up the necessary items, so use this time to offer soft praise to your dog. Tell him you love him and pet him in his favorite spots.\n7. Hug your dog. Your vet will ensure you're ready and then begin injecting the solution to euthanize your dog. Many people choose to hug their dog during these moments because the process is fairly quick. Between six and twelve seconds after the solution is delivered, your dog will take a deep breath and then appear to fall into a deep sleep before taking a few more final breaths. Some pet owners also prefer not to be in the room for the actual injection and passing. The veterinarian's office is used to people who need to cope and grieve in their own ways. Ultimately decide what is right for you.\n8. Give yourself time. Do not be embarrassed to cry in front of the vet or other employees at the clinic. They all understand what you're going through. After your dog has passed away, your veterinarian will give you the option to spend some additional one-on-one time with your dog. Some owners take this opportunity to say a few last words to their dog while others choose to pass on this option.\n9. Discuss options for the remains. After giving you the time you need, your vet will discuss options concerning what to do with your dog's remains. This may include releasing them to you for burial or cremating them, which the vet can take care of. You can choose cremation either with the intent to take the cremains with you or not. In some places, it is against the law for the vet to return your pet's body to you for burial.\n", "prediction_0": "Comforting a dying dog can be a challenging experience, but there are several things you can do to help make your pet comfortable during this difficult time.

This way, you can import files from the shared directory using that alias in both projects.\n\n   In your `tsconfig.json` files:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"extends\": \"../node_modules/typescript/config/tsconfig.json\",\n     \"compilerOptions\": {\n       // Your other options here\n     },\n     \"lib\": [\n       // Your other libs here\n     ],\n     \"paths\": {\n       \"*\": [\n           \"./\",\n           \"../shared/*\"\n       ],\n       \"shared/*\": [\n           \"../shared/*\"\n       ]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Now you can import files from the `shared` directory using the `import` statement with the alias:\n   ```typescript\n   import someFunction from 'shared/some-file'\n   ```\n\n2. **Create separate `tsconfig.json` files for both the `client` and `server` shares:** You can create separate `tsconfig.json` files in the `client` and `server` directories that include only the shared files. This way, you can use the `files` or `include` properties in these files. While it might not be an ideal solution, it ensures that the IntelliSense works for both projects while targeting different ES versions.\n\n3. **Manually update the IntelliSense:** You could always manually update the list of files in IntelliSense by opening each project's `.json` file in the `.vscode` folder and adding the shared files' paths to the `\"include\"` property.\n\n   For example, under `client/.vscode/launch.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n     \"configurations\": [\n       {\n         \"name\": \"launch\",\n         \"type\": \"node\",\n         \"request\": \"launch\",\n         \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/next-pwa/next.js\",\n         \"args\": [\"build\"],\n         \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n         \"preLaunchTask\": \"build:dev\",\n         \"outDir\": \"../out\",\n         \"sourceMapPathOverrides\": {\n           \"**/*\": \"${webroot}/*\"\n         },\n         \"dependencyReports\": {\n           \"enabled\": true\n         },\n         \"env\": {\n           \"NODE_ENV\": \"production\",\n           \"PWA_BUILD_FILENAME\": \"static/manifest.json\",\n           \"PWA_MANIFEST_FILE\": \"manifest.json\",\n           \"BASE_URL\": \"/\",\n           \"HOST\": \"localhost:3000\"\n         },\n         \"traceReferences\": true,\n         \"sourceFileMap\": {\n           \"globalObject\": \"window\",\n           \"sourceRoot\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n         },\n         \"settings\": {\n           \"react\": {\n             \"fastRefresh\": true\n           }\n         }\n       }\n     ],\n     \"setupTasks\": [],\n     \"scripts\": {}\n   }\n   // Add the following at the end\n   {\n     \"include\": [\"../shared/**/*\"]\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Under `server/.vscode/launch.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n     \"configurations\": [\n       // Your configurations here\n     ],\n      \"setupTasks\": [],\n      \"scripts\": {\n        \"start\": \"ts-node ./server.tsx\",\n        \"dev\": \"nodemon --watch '.**' --exec 'ts-node ./server.tsx'\"\n      },\n      // Add the following at the end\n      {\n        \"include\": [\"../../shared/**/*\"]\n      }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Note that this method updates the IntelliSense only for that specific file and not the whole project so you might consider using your preferred method to keep the shared files consistent across projects", "prediction_2": "If you're unable to use `files` or `include` in your `tsconfig.json` files to include the shared directory in both projects, and you don't want to wait for `filesGlob` to be available, there are a few possible workarounds:\n\n1. **Use Symlinks:** You can create symbolic links (symlinks) between the shared directory in each project. This way, both projects will be pointing to the same physical directory, and Visual Studio Code should automatically pick up the shared files for intellisense and other features. To create a symlink on Windows, you can use the `mklink` command in the Command Prompt. For example, in the `server` directory, run `mklink /D shared ../shared`. Similarly, in the `client` directory, run `mklink /D shared ../shared`.\n2. **Use a Multi-root Workspace:** Instead of having separate projects, you can create a multi-root workspace in Visual Studio Code that includes all three directories: `client`, `shared`, and `server`. Then, you can add separate `tsconfig.json` files to each directory. This way, Visual Studio Code will recognize the shared files across all the projects in the workspace, and you'll get intellisense and other features for those files. To create a multi-root workspace, go to `File > Open Folder` and select all three directories. Visual Studio Code will automatically create a `.codeworkspace` file in the root directory that defines the multi-root workspace.\n3. **Use a Monorepo Tool:** Another option is to use a monorepo tool like Lerna, Yarn Workspaces, or Nx to manage multiple projects as a single repository. Each project will have its own `tsconfig.json` file, and you can use a shared `tsconfig.base.json` file to define common settings for all projects. This way, you can include the shared directory in all projects without having to repeat the configuration in each `tsconfig.json` file. Visual Studio Code should then automatically pick up the shared files across all the projects for intellisense and other features.\n\nThese are just a few possible ways to share code across multiple projects in Visual Studio Code and get intellisense and other features for those files. Each approach has its pros and cons, so choose the one that fits your specific use case best.", "prediction_3": "If you're looking for a solution within the Visual Studio Code IDE for TypeScript projects with a shared directory that is not directly included in the tsconfig files, there are a few workarounds you can consider. However, please note that none of these options provide perfect solutions, and each comes with its own set of limitations.\n\n1. Manual imports: You can manually import the shared files into the files that you want to use them in both client and server projects. Although this is not an ideal solution for large projects and might require constant updates, it does allow for proper intellisense.\n\n2. Symlinks: Create symbolic links to the shared directory within both the client and server directories. Visual Studio Code supports symbolic links, which can be used to link files and folders across different directories. By doing this, you can achieve the effect of having the shared directory in both projects, but you might still face limitations when it comes to automatic inclusion in the TypeScript compilation flow.\n\n3. File renaming or moving: Rename or move the shared directory into either the client or server directory, and update the paths accordingly. This can be a bit cumbersome, especially if the shared directory contains a significant amount of code.\n\n4. External package: If the shared directory consists of reusable modules, consider turning it into a separate npm package. This way, both projects can import the shared modules through npm, avoiding the need for manual inclusions or symbolic links.\n\n5. Wait for TypeScript v4.5 or above: As you mentioned, TypeScript has a new feature called `filesGlob` that can be used to dynamically include files in your project based on certain patterns. This feature is currently in beta and will be officially released in TypeScript 4.5 or later. You can try the beta version of TypeScript and experiment with this feature if you'd like to, but keep in mind that it might not be completely stable yet.\n\nIn summary, the ideal solution would be to have a shared directory that is automatically included in both the client and server projects, and has proper TypeScript intellisense support. While there are some workarounds and limitations to the current setup, the best approach might be to wait for the official release of filesGlob in TypeScript 4.5 or above, or to consider external solutions like package management or manual imports.", "prediction_4": "If you cannot use `files` or `includes` in your `tsconfig.json` files to include the shared directory, an alternative approach would be to use a `workspace` configuration instead.\n\nYou can create a `wsconfig.json` file at the root level of your project with the following content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"My Project\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"ignoredFiles\": [\"node_modules/*\"],\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"client\",\n      \"type\": \"typescript\",\n      \"request\": \"folders/client\",\n      \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"es5\",\n        \"lib\": [\"dom\", \"dom.iterable\", \"esnext\"],\n        \"baseUrl\": \"..\",\n        \"paths\": {\n          \"*\": [\"node_modules/*\"],\n          \"@\": \"shared\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"server\",\n      \"type\": \"typescript\",\n      \"request\": \"folders/server\",\n      \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"es6\",\n        \"lib\": [\"dom\", \"esnext\"],\n        \"baseUrl\": \"..\",\n        \"paths\": {\n          \"*\": [\"node_modules/*\"],\n          \"@\": \"shared\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nMake sure the `wsconfig.json` file is in the root level of your project, and update the `baseUrl` and `paths` according to your project structure. With this approach, Visual Studio Code should recognize the shared directory for intellisense and other features.\n\nIf the `filesGlob` feature isn't available yet, you can use the `workspace` configuration as a workaround for including the shared directory in both projects."}

{"question": "What is the significance of 1/1/1753 in SQL Server?", "answer": "The decision to use 1st January 1753 (```1753-01-01```) as the minimum date value for a datetime in SQL Server goes back to its Sybase origins.\nThe significance of the date itself though can be attributed to this man.\n\nPhilip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield. Who steered the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 through the British Parliament. This legislated for the adoption of the Gregorian calendar for Britain and its then colonies. \n\nThere were some missing days (internet archive link) in the British calendar in 1752 when the adjustment was finally made from the Julian calendar. September 3, 1752 to September 13, 1752 were lost.\nKalen Delaney explained the choice this way\n\n> So, with 12 days lost, how can you compute dates? For example, how can you compute the number of days between October 12, 1492, and July 4, 1776? Do you include those missing 12 days? To avoid having to solve this problem, the original Sybase SQL Server developers decided not to allow dates before 1753. You can store earlier dates by using character fields, but you can't use any datetime functions with the earlier dates that you store in character fields.\n\nThe choice of 1753 does seem somewhat anglocentric however as many catholic countries in Europe had been using the calendar for 170 years before the British implementation (originally delayed due to opposition by the church). Conversely many countries did not reform their calendars until much later, 1918 in Russia. Indeed the October Revolution of 1917 started on 7 November under the Gregorian calendar.\nBoth ```datetime``` and the new ```datetime2``` datatype mentioned in Joe's answer do not attempt to account for these local differences and simply use the Gregorian Calendar.\nSo with the greater range of ```datetime2```\n```SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR, DATEADD(DAY,-5,CAST('1752-09-13' AS DATETIME2)),100)\n```\nReturns\n```Sep  8 1752 12:00AM\n```\nOne final point with the ```datetime2``` data type is that it uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar projected backwards to well before it was actually invented so is of limited use in dealing with historic dates.\nThis contrasts with other Software implementations such as the Java Gregorian Calendar class which defaults to following the Julian Calendar for dates until October 4, 1582 then jumping to October 15, 1582 in the new Gregorian calendar. It correctly handles the Julian model of leap year before that date and the Gregorian model after that date. The cutover date may be changed by the caller by calling ```setGregorianChange()```. \nA fairly entertaining article discussing some more peculiarities with the adoption of the calendar can be found here.", "prediction_0": "The date 1/1/1753 is not particularly significant in SQL Server itself, but it is an important date in the context of how SQL Server handles date and time data.\n\nBy default, SQL Server uses the Gregorian calendar for date calculations. However, before the year 1753, there was a discrepancy between the Julian and Gregorian calendars that can cause issues when working with dates in SQL Server.\n\nPrior to 1753, the Julian calendar contained an extra day every 400 years. When the Gregorian calendar was introduced, the extra day was removed, resulting in a difference of 11 days between the two calendars for certain years. Specifically, the Julian date 1/1/1753 corresponds to the Gregorian date 13/9/1752.\n\nTherefore, if you work with historical data that predates 1753, or if you're dealing with data from external sources that may use the Julian calendar, it's important to be aware of this discrepancy and adjust your date calculations accordingly in SQL Server or when converting data into SQL Server.\n\nAdditionally, some SQL Server functions, such as DATEADD(), have an optional third parameter that specifies which calendar system to use for date arithmetic calculations. By default, it uses the Gregorian calendar, but you can specify the Julian calendar (J) if needed.\n\nSo while 1/1/1753 itself may not have any inherent significance in SQL Server, understanding the implications of the Julian and Gregorian calendar difference for dates before this year is essential for working with historical data in SQL Server.", "prediction_1": "In SQL Server, 1/1/1753 is not particularly significant as a built-in constant or system function.

In this system, 1/1/1753 would have a different meaning and significance. But with the introduction of the new (and now standard) SQL Server DateTime and DateTime2 data types in SQL Server 2005, the Deprecated Date System was deprecated and no longer used. Therefore, the significance of 1/1/1753 in SQL Server mainly refers to its historical position in the Gregorian calendar.", "prediction_2": "In SQL Server, 1/1/1753 is an important date because it is the start date for the Julian date system used by SQL Server's DATETIME and SMALLDATETIME data types prior to SQL Server 2005. For these data types, the range of valid dates starts from this point (01-01-1753) and ends at January 8, 0079.\n\nIt's essential to note that SQL Server employs two different date systems:\n\n1. The default date system: SQL Server 2005 and later versions use the default date system, which is the \"Coordinated Universal Time\" (UTC) or \"Gregorian calendar.\" In this calendar, the start date is January 1, 0001.\n\n2. The legacy date system: SQL Server versions prior to 2005 applied the Julian date system with a start date of January 1, 1753.\n\nWhile SQL Server itself supports both systems internally, it's crucial to understand that the way data is displayed and interpreting it may differ when converting data from one date system to another or working with mixed-version environments. To account for this, use the CONVERT() function to explicitly convert your date/time values to the target format.\n\nUnderstanding the historical significance of 1/1/1753 in SQL Server becomes essential when dealing with legacy systems, migration scenarios, or working with older data files.", "prediction_3": "In SQL Server, there isn't any specific significance attached to the date 1/1/1753. However, it is important to note that SQL Server uses the Julian date system as its base calendar, which was widely used before the Gregorian calendar became more prevalent.\n\nThe Julian date system, introduced by Julius Caesar in 46 BC, was designed to keep the calendar year in sync with the solar year. However, it has a small error, causing the calendar year to slowly drift with respect to the solar year. To address this issue, the Gregorian calendar was introduced in 1582, which made a number of adjustments to the Julian calendar to bring it back in line with the solar year. Many countries adopted the Gregorian calendar between the 16th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe Julian date system designates January 1, 1752 as a leap day in the Gregorian calendar, which makes the Julian date for that day January 28, 1752. However, the Julian date system does not recognize the Gregorian leap year adjustment for earlier dates, including 1/1/1753. Therefore, in the context of the SQL Server's base calendar, 1/1/1753 has no particular significance.\n\nWhen working with dates in SQL Server, it's essential to be mindful of both the underlying Julian date system and the different calendar systems, such as the Gregorian calendar, to avoid potential discrepancies and complications.", "prediction_4": "In SQL Server, 1/1/1753 is not particularly significant as a built-in constant or system value. While it is an invalid date in the SQL Server calendar system, it can be represented as adate data type and manipulated like any other date. However, there are some contexts in which understanding this date might be important:\n\n1. Historical perspective: January 1, 1753, marks the beginning of the Gregorian calendar reform in Great Britain and its colonies. Prior to this date, the country used the Julian calendar. The switch to the Gregorian calendar caused a discrepancy of 11 days, which is why the number of days between December 31, 1752, and January 1, 1753, was only 28.\n\n2. Database design considerations: When working on historical data spanning multiple calendar systems, it's essential to keep track of the calendar rules that apply during each period. SQL Server itself doesn't contain any specific reference to this date in its built-in system functions or metadata. However, understanding the context of calendar changes during specific periods, such as the shift from Julian to Gregorian, can help ensure data accuracy and consistency when designing date-related database features or applications.\n\n3. Date handling functions and techniques: As mentioned earlier, 1/1/1753 is just an ordinary date in SQL Server. However, understanding various date handling techniques and functions, such as DATEADD, DATEDIFF, CAST, and CONVERT, can help you work with dates like 1/1/1753 effectively. These functions can help you perform tasks such as arithmetic calculations, format display, or cross-database comparisons. For instance, if you need to check whether a specific date falls within the Gregorian reform period, you might use these functions to calculate the difference between that date and January 1, 1753."}
{"question": "In Civilization V, you attain a cultural victory by accumulating enough culture to purchase at least 36 social policies, and then building a wonder. The catch is that the more cities you build, the more culture you need to generate before you hit the next \"plateau\" of culture.\nWhat is the ideal number of cities for a cultural victory? Does it change over time? ", "answer": "The question you're really asking is &quot;When does the combined culture / turn of an additional city outstrip the increase in social policy cost incurred by founding that city?&quot;\nThe short answer is...\nWe know that adding another city increases the culture costs by approximately 30% of the base cost (that of 1 city). Therefore:\nIf your maximum potential culture / turn won't increase by at least 30% due to the new city, you are hurting, not helping, the time till your next social policy.\n(This may be slightly hard to calculate, and if you take too long to reach your &quot;maximum potential culture / turn&quot; you're actually wasting turns.)\nThe long answer is...\nIt depends\nTo begin with, we need to make some assumptions:\n\n* When you found a new city, you can get its culture / turn maximized within a single turn by buying the necessary building improvements (monument, etc).\n\n* Ignore city-states, leader specific abilities, +culture social policies, and wonders. These all help produce culture, and will shift the &quot;ideal city count&quot; down, but do so inconsistently. To produce an &quot;ideal&quot; city count, we limit ourselves by era and improvements alone.\n\n* This list of social policy costs is accurate for the given parameters: medium map and normal speed.\n\nAnd now, some math.\nThe 1st social policy costs 25 points with a single city. In the ancient era, your cities can generate 2 culture / turn due to the monument. (Remember, we're ignoring the palace for now)\nThis means that it will take 13 turns (Ceiling(25/2) to enact the policy, or 9 turns (ceiling (45/4) with two cities. We can continue this extrapolation -- 8 turns with 3 cities, 7 turns with 4 cities, 6 turns with 5 cities, and we finally reach diminishing returns at city 6 (also 6 turns).\nFor the second social policy, the ramifications of the # of cities gets magnified due to a larger starting value: One city takes 23 turns, two cities take 15 turns, three cities take 13 turns, four cities take 12, five cities take 10, and again, we run into diminishing returns cap out at at six cities (10 turns).\nIt is not until the 4th social policy that this trend is broken and diminishing returns end at the NINTH! city.\nRemember -- this assumes that each city has a monument the minute it is founded.\nNow let's say we've reached the classical age, and have temples in addition to monuments. Each city is now generating 5 culture.\nThe first policy takes 5 turns with a single city, 4 turns with two, and 3 with three.\nWhat (hopefully) becomes clear is that we reached diminishing returns (4 cities as opposed to 6 cities) much faster when each individual city's contribution is higher. The more culture any one city is capable of producing, the more incentive there is to produce more cities. Even if you don't manage to build every +culture improvement immediately, you're still likely to come out ahead (as long as you're pre-diminishing returns).\nSo while the optimal number of cities changes due to any number of factors, you can probably safely not shoot yourself in the foot if you stay between three and six cities, with six being on the high end.", "prediction_0": "The ideal number of cities for a cultural victory in Civilization V depends on various factors, including the specific playstyle, available policies, and the player's strategic goals.

As a rough estimate, a player might aim for around 16-18 cities or more, depending on the specific policies and wonders they are pursuing. \n\nThe ideal number of cities for a cultural victory may change over time due to several factors:\n\n1. Researching social policies: Each social policy adds to the total culture cost for the next policy or wonder, so the more policies you research, the more culture you will need.\n\n2. Wonders: Different wonders have different culture costs, so the player needs to consider the culture cost of the desired wonder and plan accordingly. For instance, the Colosseum has a lower culture cost than the Great Library or the Hanging Gardens.\n\n3. Policy synergy: Some social policies can increase the cultural output of cities, while others may decrease it. For example, the Harmony policy from the Eco-Tech tree can increase the culture growth rate. In contrast, the Industry policy from the Industrial tree decreases the culture growth rate.\n\n4. City specialization: Focusing on specialization in certain cities can increase the overall cultural production. For example, dedicating a city to a Great Person or a specific government type can lead to increased cultural growth, which might influence the optimal number of cities for a cultural win. \n\n5. Terrains and resources: Terrains and resources can significantly impact the cultural growth rate of a city, making it essential to optimize city placement and planning. For instance, cities located on hills or adjacencies with holy sites or ruins can increase cultural growth.\n\nIn summary, there is no definitive answer to what the ideal number of cities is for a cultural victory in Civilization V, as it depends on various factors unique to each playthrough.

Social Policies: Social Policies can significantly impact the culture generation of your cities. Policies like Granary, Library, and Theater Square can provide bonuses to culture production.\n\n3. Culture Spikes: Cultural victories often involve taking advantage of \"culture spikes,\" which occur when a city reaches a milestone in its cultural development. For example, the first and third Tier II city will generate a significant culture bonus. The ideal number of cities can depend on when you want to achieve these spikes.\n\n4.

Readability: Using `SELECT *` can make your code less readable, as it doesn't make it clear which columns you actually need. This can make it harder for other developers to understand your code and maintain it in the future.\n\nThat being said, there are definitely situations where using `SELECT *` makes sense. For example, when you're working with a small table or testing a query, it may be more convenient to use `SELECT *` instead of listing out every column. However, as you grow your application and your database schema becomes more complex, it's a good practice to be more specific with your queries and only select the columns you actually need.\n\nIf you do decide to use `SELECT *`, be aware of the potential downsides and make sure you have a good reason for doing so. And if you do add a new column to your table, don't forget to update your queries to include it!", "prediction_4": "Selecting all columns using `SELECT *` can be considered bad practice for several reasons:\n\n1. **Unintended Consequences:** As your database schema evolves, new columns may be added. When you use `SELECT *`, you may end up selecting columns that you do not need in your application, leading to unnecessary data transfer and processing. This can impact performance and increase the risk of errors.\n\n2. **Lack of Flexibility:** When you use `SELECT *`, you may miss out on the opportunity to optimize your queries by selecting only the columns that are required. This can lead to inefficient queries and performance issues.\n\n3. **Security:** When you use `SELECT *`, you may inadvertently expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. By selecting only the necessary columns, you can reduce the risk of data breaches and protect the privacy of your data.\n\n4. **Code Maintainability:** Although it may seem that `SELECT *` reduces the amount of code you need to change when adding a new column, it can actually make your code less maintainable. By being specific about which columns you need, you can ensure that your queries remain focused and efficient, making it easier to understand and maintain your codebase over time.\n\nTherefore, it is best practice to specify the columns you need in your queries, rather than using `SELECT *`. This leads to more efficient queries, reduced risk of errors, improved security, and more maintainable code."}

The sun peeked over the horizon, casting long, golden rays over the slumbering streets, promising another day filled with the mundane and the ordinary. But little did the unsuspecting residents know, today would be a day for the history books.\n\nThe first stirrings of the day came from the quaint little bakery, where the master baker, Thomas, began his daily ritual. With the precision of a watchmaker and the passion of a true artist, he mixed the dough, kneaded it until it was pliable and perfect, and then shaped it into the delicious pastries that had become the pride of Meadowgrove. Each loaf of bread, each croissant, each crumbly scone was a work of art, a testament to Thomas's unwavering dedication. But as he gently placed the first batch in the oven, a tremor ran through his hand. Was it the early morning chill, or was it something more? Could it be that today, the ordinary would become extraordinary?\n\nMeanwhile, at the post office, Postmaster Peter was busily sorting the mail, his keen eyes scanning the addresses, searching for the one that would bring excitement to his day. Each envelope, each parcel, each letter was a mystery waiting to be unraveled, and he reveled in the anticipation. He had spent a lifetime making sure that every piece of mail reached its intended recipient, and today would be no different. But as he reached for the next envelope, his hand shaking ever so slightly, he could sense that something momentous was about to occur.\n\nAcross town, in the small, quaint library, Librarian Amelia was preparing for another day of sharing her love of literature with the townsfolk. She had spent decades collecting the finest books, each one a precious treasure in its own right. And as she placed the most recent addition on the shelf, a first edition of \"Wuthering Heights,\" she knew that this day would be one for the ages.\n\nBut even as these ordinary lives continued their daily routines, the tension built, the anticipation grew. The sun rose higher in the sky, bathing the town in a warm, golden glow that promised adventure and excitement. And it was then that the first strange occurrence took place.\n\nAt the bakery, a loaf of bread, fresh from the oven, rose to its full height and then, defying all laws of physics, broke free from its pan and soared through the open window, landing gently in the hands of a shocked Thomas. \"How extraordinary,\" he exclaimed, a wide smile spreading across his face. Had his bread finally come to life?\n\nAt the post office, the next envelope Peter picked up was not addressed to anyone in Meadowgrove, but rather to him. It contained an invitation to an exclusive art exhibition in Paris, an offer he had only ever dreamed of receiving. \"This is it,\" he thought, his heart racing with excitement. He had spent his entire life in Meadowgrove, but was it time for him to explore the wider world?\n\nAnd at the library, as Amelia placed the latest addition to the collection on the shelf, the ancient, battered cover of \"Pride and Prejudice\" cracked open, revealing a note inside. \"To Amelia, my dearest librarian,\" it read, \"May your love of books never falter. Yours, Mr. Darcy.\" The note was signed with a flourish that could only belong to the elusive literary hero. Was it a hoax, or was Mr. Darcy himself finally acknowledging Amelia's devotion?\n\nNews of these extraordinary occurrences spread like wildfire throughout the town, and soon the residents of Meadowgrove were awash in a wave of excitement and wonder. Could it be that their quiet, ordinary lives were hiding secrets of magic and mystery? And if so, what other wonders lay hidden, waiting to be discovered?\n\nAs the day wore on, and the sun began its slow descent towards the horizon, the people of Meadowgrove gathered together in the town square, their faces glowing with hope and anticipation.

The dew-kissed blades of grass glistened in the early light, while the birds chimed in with their morning serenade, filling the air with their harmonious melody. A seemingly ordinary day was about to unfold, yet little did the unsuspecting townsfolk know that hidden beneath the monotony of this day lay a tapestry of drama and intrigue.\n\nIn the heart of Middleton, nestled among the quaint cottages, stood the un assuming abode of the Widow Thompson. As she stirred from her slumber, her eyes, as sharp as a hawk, scrutinized the creases on her bedsheets, mentally preparing herself for the labors of the day ahead. With a deep, steadying breath, she swung her weary legs over the side of the bed and placed her sizeable, calloused feet upon the cold, wooden floor. Sustaining the weight of her world-weary frame, she rose, her bones protesting with every inch she traversed towards the mirror. The wizened, gnarled visage that stared back at her bore the wrinkles and lines of a life filled with toil and sorrow. And yet, deep within her, there remained an unquenchable fire, a stubborn, resilient spirit that refused to be quelled by the passage of time.\n\nMeanwhile, an aromatic scent wafted across the sleepy town, emanating from the kitchen of the local bakery, where Master Baker O'Reilly had long since commenced his daily ritual of transforming ordinary flour, water, and yeast into mouth-watering loaves of bread. The yeasty aroma permeated the air, a clarion call to the slumbering populace. As they emerged, blinking and rubbing their eyes, they could not help but be drawn to the bakery, their stomachs rumbling with anticipation.\n\nAt the town's center, the Clocktower stood proudly, its minute and hour hands turning in perfect harmony, ticking away at the inexorable march of time. An unassuming figure, in the guise of old Mr. Jenkins, the town's clockkeeper, attended to the inner workings of the timepiece with a sense of pride and responsibility. Despite the monotony of the task, Mr. Jenkins had taken great pride in tending to the Clocktower for the past forty years, maintaining the delicate balance that ensured the regularity of the town's heartbeat.\n\nThe day wore on, the sun climbed steadily in the heavens, casting long, dappled shadows across the cobblestone streets of Middleton. In the market square, a lively hubbub of activity had descended, as shopkeepers hawked their wares and countryfolk exchanged news and gossip. Amidst the clamor, young master Samuel, the scion of the prosperous Blackwell family, held court, regaling anyone who would listen with his tales of heroics and valor.\n\nYet beneath the veneer of small-town placidity, dangerous undercurrents began to swell. Whispers of treachery and deceit had been simmering, festering beneath the surface, threatening to boil over and disrupt the harmonious balance of Middleton. The winds of change were stirring, and as the sun continued its descent, the shadows grew longer, casting an ominous premonition over the town.\n\nIn the depths of her secluded garden, the Widow Thompson found herself engrossed in a letter, her eyes scanning the cramped, ink-stained parchment with an intensity that bordered on obsession. Her heart raced as the words danced before her, their meaning all too clear. A storm was brewing, one that threatened to rend the fabric of her small world asunder. The once unassuming day had given way to a cauldron of danger, and the calm, orderly existence of Middleton was about to be irrevocably changed.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting the sky in a breathtaking display of reds, purples, and oranges, the townsfolk began to settle in for the night.

The postman trudged through the streets, delivering letters that held secrets whispered across great distances. In the local bakery, the baker painstakingly crafted loaves of bread, each one a testament to the simple, primal beauty of its creation. Meanwhile, in the town square, children gathered to trade tales of the night before, their voices rising and falling as they spoke in hushed, urgent breaths, their eyes wide with the wonder of the extraordinary.\n\nIn the quiet precincts of the town library, the librarian, Miss Adelaide, engaged in an epic battle of wills with a wayward dust mote that seemed intent on defying all logic and order.

In a triumphant sigh, the librarian returned to her beloved books, their pages filled with tales of adventure, romance, and excitement.\n\nMeanwhile, in the heart of the town square, the clock tower struck the hour, its ancient bells reverberating through the still air. The bells, which had tolled out the hours for decades, seemed to ring with an almost divine intensity, their reverberations touching the hearts of every townsfolk with a gentle reminder of the fleeting nature of time.\n\nAs the day wore on, the town of Meadowville continued to revel in the quiet drama of the ordinary.

{"question": "How to hold your breath for long periods of time?", "answer": "The ability to hold your breath for a long period of time is a much sought-after skill. Maybe you want to last longer underwater while diving or surfing, or maybe you're just looking for an impressive party trick. Whatever the reason, it is actually surprisingly easy to increase the amount of time you can go without breathing, provided you use the right training techniques and follow adequate safety precautions. Read below to find out how.\n\n## Optimize your lung capacity\n\n1. Do exercises to increase your lung capacity. While there is no way to increase your lung size, there are many ways to increase the amount of air your lungs take in, and the efficiency with which they capture oxygen. In particular, a rigorous exercise routine can help to strengthen your lungs and maximize their capacity to hold air. Do plenty of cardio. Incorporating some intense cardio workouts into your weekly routine can do wonders for your lungs. Running, skipping, aerobics and swimming are all great forms of cardiovascular exercise which get the blood pumping and the lungs working hard to supply the body with the oxygen it needs to keep going. Try doing exercising in intense 30 minute bursts, pushing your body to its limits, to achieve the best result. Exercise in water. Exercising in water (swimming, water aerobics, underwater weight training) is also a form of cardio exercise, but the water provides an element of resistance which requires the body to work harder to complete each task. As a result, the lungs need to work harder to supply the body with oxygen, causing their air capacity to increase significantly over time. Work-out at high elevation. At higher elevations, there is less oxygen in the air, meaning your lungs have to work harder to supply the body with oxygen. This is an excellent way to strengthen the lungs, but you must be careful not to train to hard, or you could potentially fall victim to altitude sickness.\n2. Lose weight. Any excess baggage reduces your body's efficiency in using oxygen, as there is increased body mass to which your blood must pump oxygen. As a result, many competitive breath holders will attempt to shed any extra pounds in the weeks coming up to a competition. This weight loss should be achieved in a strictly healthy way - through exercise and balanced diet - as weakening your body through crash dieting will negatively impact your ability to hold your breath. The world record breath holder, Aleix Segura Vendrell, is reported to have lost weight for 4 months before attempting to beat the world record for holding breath underwater, in an effort to improve his ratio of body volume to lung volume.\n3. Quit smoking. The fact that smoking has a negative impact on lung strength and capacity is common knowledge. Quitting can considerably increase your lungs' ability to release carbon dioxide and absorb oxygen, even within a matter of weeks. So if you are trying to strengthen your lungs and increase their capacity, giving up smoking is undoubtedly the first thing on the to-do list. You should also try to avoid second-hand smoke as far as possible, as inhaling someone else's cigarette smoke can have a negative effect on your lungs.\n4. Take up a wind or brass instrument. These types of instruments require plenty of lung power, making them a great way to improve lung strength and increase your ability to control your breathing. And aside from that, playing an instrument is a fantastic life skill, which can provide immense personal satisfaction. The flute, clarinet, oboe and saxophone are all good options when it comes to wind instruments, while the trumpet, trombone and tuba are popular brass options. If you have a good voice, singing is another great musical aid to improving lung power. Singing requires immense control of one's breathing, making it an excellent complimentary activity for aspiring breath-holders.\n\n\n## Train techniques for hold your breath\n\n1. Practice deep breathing. Before holding your breath, inhale and exhale slowly from deep within your diaphragm. By doing this, you're ridding your lungs of low-quality air. Spend five seconds breathing in, then hold the breath for one second, before breathing out for ten seconds. Continue deep breathing for two minutes, and be sure that when you exhale, you push out every last \"drop\" of air. As you exhale, push your tongue up against your teeth.This forms a valve which helps to control the release of air. Your breath should make a hissing sound as it is released. Deep breathing allows your body to take in excess oxygen, which it can then store in the blood cells. This helps when holding your breath as your body can use the stored oxygen to continue functioning, even when you are not breathing.\n2. Purge the CO2 from your lungs. When holding your breath, the pressure you feel in your lungs is not the result of a need to breathe, but rather the result of a build-up of CO2, fighting to be released. This build-up of CO2 becomes increasingly painful as time goes on. To minimize this build-up, it is necessary to purge any pre-existing CO2 from your lungs, before holding your breath. To do this:\n\t* Exhale forcefully, pushing as much air out of your lungs as possible. Puff out your cheeks as you do this, and imagine you are trying to blow a toy sailboat across a stretch of water. Once you have exhaled completely, inhale quickly and repeat. Try to keep your body as still as possible while you do this, to avoid expending any of the stored oxygen from the previous step.\n3. Take a breath and hold it for one minute and thirty seconds. This is a practice run which will allow your body to adjust to the sensation of going without air. Use a timer to count down the 90 seconds, and don't attempt to hold your breath for any longer just yet. When you inhale, don't breathe in so much that you're about to pop; this creates tension in your body and causes you to expend more energy. Instead, fill your lung capacity to about 80-85% capacity so that you still have room to relax. Once the 90 seconds is up, exhale briefly to rid your lungs of the used air, then take three breaths, inhaling and exhaling fully. This is known as semi-purging.\n4. Repeat the process of deep breathing and purging, then hold your breath for two minutes and thirty seconds. Once the first 90 second practice run is up, repeat the deep breathing and purging exercises. Perform each exercise for a duration of one minute and thirty seconds. Once this is done, take a breath and hold it for two minutes and thirty seconds, timing it on a stopwatch. Do not attempt to hold your breath for any longer than this. Once the time is up, exhale to release the used air and take three semi-purge breaths. Follow this with two minutes of deep breathing and a minute and a half of purging. You are now ready to try holding your breath for as long as possible.\n5. Splash cold water on your face. At this point, you may decide to splash your face with some cold water before attempting to hold your breath. It has been observed that putting a person's face in contact with cold water triggers bradycardia, or the slowing of the heart rate, which is the first phase of the mammalian diving reflex. However, this step is purely optional. You don't need to actually put your entire head underwater, though. Just splash some cold water on your face right before you hold your breath, or try using a cold, wet washcloth. Don't use an ice pack instead of water, though; the same study suggests that the shock of something too cold triggers other reflexes. Just make sure the water is at a temperature of approximately 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C) and that the rest of your body is in a relaxed position.\n6. Take a breath and hold it for as long as possible. Assume a comfortable seated position and take a deep breath, filling your lungs to about 80-85% of capacity. Hold your breath for as long as possible, staying completely still to avoid expending unnecessary energy and wasting oxygen. It is usually better to have someone else timing your progress, as time will pass more quickly and you will be able to hold your breath for longer if you are not constantly watching the clock. Holding your breath for long periods of time can be painful, and it usually necessary to find a way to distract yourself if you are to successfully achieve your goal. One popular distraction technique is to move through the alphabet from A to Z, thinking of a friend, celebrity or historical figure whose name begins with each letter. Aleix Segura Vendrell, who set a world record for holding his breath underwater for 24 minutes and 3 seconds, is a proponent of this very technique. Don't hold air in your cheeks. This method is meant for an air reserve, which requires \"letting go\" of the air in your lungs and switching it with the air in your cheeks. This is known as \"circular breathing\" and can be very difficult to achieve, usually resulting in the breath-holder losing both air reserves. Therefore, it may be best to avoid this method for the time being.\n7. Relax every muscle in your body. It is vital that you relax completely and release any tension from your body as you hold your breath. Close your eyes and focus on releasing the tension from each body part in turn, starting with your feet, and moving slowly upwards along your body, all the way up to your neck and head. By doing this, it is possible to significantly lower your heart rate and increase the time you are able to hold your breath for. Concentrate on something that's relaxing to you. When you can't concentrate anymore, distract yourself by doing something with your hands, like counting to 99 with your fingers. Try not to move during any point when holding your breath. When you move, you waste oxygen and that will cut down the time you're able to go without breathing. Stay still.\n8. Exhale slowly. When you can't hold your breath anymore, try to avoid exhaling all the air in your lungs in a mad rush. First, exhale about 20% of your air, then inhale again so that oxygen gets to your most critical areas faster. Then you can exhale and inhale completely.\n9. Repeat these steps 3-4 times per session. It is not recommended to do this any more, as it could damage your lungs and body. Try one session in the morning and one session at night if you wish. Keep practicing and before you know it, you will be able to hold your breath for several minutes.\n\n\n## Take the necessary safety precautions\n\n1. Always practice with a partner. It is highly advisable that you practice holding your breath with a partner. The main reason for this is that they can ensure your safety if you happen to pass out (which is fairly common during limit-testing training sessions), preventing you from hurting yourself and taking care of you while you recover your senses. In addition, a partner can help to time your breath-holding sessions, notifying you at each 30 second interval.\n2. Practice sitting up, rather than lying down. The best position to practice holding your breath in is sitting upright in a comfortable position, such as on a sofa or armchair. This allows you to expend as little energy as possible while holding your breath. It is not advised that you lie down while holding your breath, as you run the risk of choking on your tongue if you happen to pass out.\n3. Do not attempt to do this underwater, unless supervised by a professional. Although the purpose of learning to hold your breath for longer is usually for use underwater, you should never do underwater training alone, without supervision. As mentioned before, it is quite common for people to black out or lose consciousness after holding their breath for prolonged periods, and if this happens underwater it can lead to drowning. Even practicing with a partner can be dangerous, as an untrained eye may be unable to tell the difference between someone who is holding their breath and someone who has passed out. If you do decide to practice with a partner, make sure that you decide on a hand signal which you can give at regular intervals to indicate to your partner that you are okay.\n", "prediction_0": "Holding your breath for extended periods of time requires practice and good breathing techniques to ensure you have enough oxygen in your body. Here are some steps that can help you improve your breath-holding ability:\n\n1. Train gradually: Don't try to hold your breath for a long time right away. Start with small intervals, such as 10-15 seconds, and gradually increase the duration as your body adapts.\n\n2. Practice relaxation techniques: Being calm and relaxed helps conserve oxygen in your body. Try deep, controlled breathing exercises to reduce stress and improve your ability to hold your breath.\n\n3. Use the 4-7-8 breathing technique: This technique helps you gain control over your breathing and can help you prepare for a breath hold. Inhale through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of seven, and exhale through your mouth for a count of eight.\n\n4. Pursed-lip breathing: After holding your breath, exhale through pursed lips to help clear your lungs and prevent hyperventilation. This can help you maintain your breath hold for a longer duration.\n\n5. Empty your lungs completely before attempting a breath hold: Breathe out as much air as possible and then hold your breath.\n\n6. Practice breath holds in a seated position: Sit comfortably with your back straight and your chest lifted to maximize your lung capacity.\n\n7. Take care of yourself before and after: Make sure you are well-rested, hydrated, and warm before attempting a breath hold. Afterward, take deep, slow breaths to help your body recover.\n\n8. Don't push too hard: Never try to hold your breath for so long that you feel uncomfortable or stressed. Pushing yourself too hard can lead to injury or a decrease in your ability to hold your breath.\n\n9.

Practicing breath holds should never feel uncomfortable or painful.", "prediction_1": "Holding your breath for extended periods of time requires proper preparation and training. Here are some steps to help you increase your breath-holding capacity:\n\n1. Practice the \"Plague Doctor Technique\": This technique involves taking a large breath, pinching your nose closed with your fingers, and then forcefully exhaling as much air as possible through pursed lips. Repeat this a few times to empty your lungs. Once your lungs are empty, take another deep breath and try to hold it.\n\n2. Learn to relax: Holding your breath requires you to relax your body as much as possible. practice relaxation techniques, such as deep belly breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, to help quiet your mind and reduce tension in your body.\n\n3. Train gradually: Don't try to hold your breath for long periods of time right away. Start by practicing holding your breath for 10-15 seconds, then gradually increase the length of time as your capacity improves. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and never hold your breath to the point of discomfort or pain.\n\n4. Practice equalization: If you plan to hold your breath while swimming or diving, it's important to learn how to equalize the pressure in your ears and sinuses. This involves pinching your nose closed and gently blowing while keeping your nostrils pinched. Repeat this process until you feel the pressure equalize.\n\n5. Stay hydrated: Dehydration can decrease your breath-holding capacity. Make sure you stay well-hydrated before and after practicing breath-holding techniques.\n\n6. Warm up: Warming up your body before practicing breath-holding techniques can help improve your performance. Try doing some light cardio exercises or taking a warm shower to increase your core temperature and prepare your body for the challenge.\n\n7. Practice regularly: Like any other skill, breath-holding requires regular practice to improve. Make it a habit to practice daily and gradually increase the length of time you hold your breath each day.\n\nRemember, holding your breath for extended periods of time can be dangerous, especially if you do not have proper training or experience. If you are considering taking up breath-holding as a hobby, it's important to consult with a trained professional to ensure you are practicing safely and effectively.", "prediction_2": "Holding your breath for long periods of time can be a challenging feat and requires practice and training. Here are some tips to help you improve your breath-holding ability:\n\n1. Train gradually: Don't try to hold your breath for an extended period of time right away. Start with shorter holds, such as 10 seconds, and gradually increase the duration as your body adjusts.\n2. Practice apnea training: Apnea training is a technique used by scuba divers and freedivers to improve their breath-holding ability. This involves taking several deep breaths through your nose, filling your lungs completely, then exhaling as much air as possible while pursing your lips. Hold your nose with your fingers and submerge your face in cold water, then exhale any remaining air. Repeat this process several times, gradually increasing the duration of your underwater holds. Over time, you'll be able to hold your breath for longer periods.\n3. Take deep breaths: Make sure you're taking full, deep breaths before attempting to hold your breath. Breathe in through your nose, filling your lungs completely, then exhale slowly through your mouth.\n4. Relax: Tension can make it difficult to hold your breath for long periods of time. Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization, to help reduce tension in your body.\n5. Practice good breathing habits: Avoid smoking, which can damage your lungs and reduce your breath-holding ability. Stay hydrated, as dehydration can make it harder to hold your breath.\n6. Use proper breathing techniques: When holding your breath, focus on keeping your body relaxed and your breathing slow and steady. Avoid holding your breath with tension in your chest or neck. Instead, imagine your breath moving from your chest to your abdomen as you inhale, and then out as you exhale.\n7. Train in a safe environment: Never hold your breath for too long or in a hazardous environment. Always practice in a safe, well-lit area, and have someone nearby in case of an emergency.\n\nRemember, everyone's breath-holding ability is different, and it's important to practice safely and gradually increase the duration of your holds to avoid injury.

Here are some steps to help you improve your breath-holding ability safely:\n\n1. Practice equalization: Equalization is the process of preventing the ears from popping or feeling pressure when you hold your breath. To practice equalization, pinch your nose shut before taking a breath and gently blow out of your nose while keeping your mouth closed. You should feel a subtle sensation of pressure against your forehead. This is the Valsalva maneuver, which helps to strengthen the muscles responsible for equalization.\n\n2. Develop good breathing habits: Before attempting to hold your breath, practice taking deep and relaxed breaths. Breathe in through your nose, expanding your belly as much as possible, and exhale slowly through your mouth. This type of breathing, called diaphragmatic breathing, can help you maximize your lung capacity and improve your breath-holding ability.\n\n3. Train gradually: Start by holding your breath for as long as you comfortably can. Ideally, you should hold your breath for 10-15 seconds and then release it. Gradually increase the duration of your breath-holds over time. Aim to add 5 seconds to your breath-hold time each week. Be consistent with your training and don't push yourself too hard to avoid injury.\n\n4. Use the 2:2:2 rule: If you feel the urge to take a breath during a breath-hold, practice the 2:2:2 rule. Hold your nose for 2 seconds, count to 2 in your head, release your nose for 2 seconds, and then repeat. This can help you extend your breath-hold and build endurance.\n\n5. Practice in a safe environment: Never hold your breath in a situation where you might pass out or be unable to quickly access help if something goes wrong. Stay hydrated and avoid alcohol or drugs before attempting to hold your breath.\n\n6. Focus on relaxation: Stay calm and relaxed during your breath-hold.

The colors are defined as macro constants in the `Windows.h` library, such as `FOREGROUND_RED`, `FOREGROUND_GREEN`, etc.\n\nUsing `SetConsoleTextAttribute`, you can set the console text color and intensity. To keep the current console settings (such as the background color), you need to save the current settings and restore them after setting the color. The example below shows how to do this.\n\nIn the example, I define a function `setColor` that takes the color as its argument and sets the console text color to the given color. After that, the `main` function demonstrates how to write colored text using the console output stream (`std::cout`) and the specified colors.\n\nKeep in mind that this approach only works on systems that support ANSI color sequences, such as Windows 10's command prompt or other consoles that emulate ANSI escape sequences. When using Microsoft's legacy console (with the `cmd.exe` interpreter), consider using escape sequences to generate colors instead.", "prediction_1": "To write colored text to the Windows console in C++, you can use the `SetConsoleTextAttribute` function from the `Windows.h` library.

Here's an example of reading bytes from a file using `FileInputStream`:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class InputStreamExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        File file = new File(\"example.txt\");\n        FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(file);\n\n        int data = fileInputStream.read(); // Reads a single byte\n        while (data != -1) {\n            System.out.print((char) data); // Convert byte to character\n            data = fileInputStream.read();\n        }\n\n        fileInputStream.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example shown above, we're reading bytes from a file named \"example.txt\" and printing the corresponding ASCII characters to the console.\n\n2. `OutputStream`:\n\nAn OutputStream represents an output byte stream. It allows you to write data to a destination, such as a file or a network connection. Here's an example of writing bytes to a file using `FileOutputStream`:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class OutputStreamExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        File file = new File(\"output.txt\");\n        FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(file);\n\n        String text = \"Hello, World!\";\n        byte[] bytes = text.getBytes();\n\n        fileOutputStream.write(bytes, 0, bytes.length); // Write the entire byte array\n\n        fileOutputStream.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we write a string \"Hello, World!\" to a file called \"output.txt\" by first converting the string to a byte array using the `getBytes()` method and then writing the entire byte array in one go using the `write()` method.", "prediction_3": "`InputStream` and `OutputStream` are abstract classes in Java's I/O package, which are used to read and write streams of bytes, respectively. They form the foundation of Java's stream-based I/O system.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of their use cases:\n\n**Input Stream (InputStream):** An InputStream represents a source of data that can be read byte by byte. It might come from a file, a network connection, or any other source of data. InputStream provides various methods to read data, such as `read()` method to read a single byte, `read(byte[] b, int off, int len)` method to read a certain number of bytes into a byte array, and `available()` method to determine how many bytes are available to be read.\n\n```java\npublic class ReadFile {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        InputStream in = new FileInputStream(\"input.txt\");\n        int c;\n        while ((c = in.read()) != -1) {\n            System.out.print((char) c);\n        }\n        in.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Output Stream (OutputStream):** An OutputStream represents a destination for data that can be written byte by byte. It might be a file, a network connection, or any other sink for data. OutputStream provides methods to write data, such as `write(int b)` method to write a single byte, and `write(byte[] b, int off, int len)` method to write a byte array to the output stream.\n\n```java\npublic class WriteFile {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(\"output.txt\");\n        String message = \"Java I/O examples!\";\n        out.write(message.getBytes());\n        out.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, InputStream is used to read data from a source, and OutputStream is used to write data to a destination. Both InputStream and OutputStream can be used for reading and writing data from and to various sources/destinations like files, streams, and sockets.", "prediction_4": "`InputStream` and `OutputStream` are abstract classes in Java used for handling input and output streams of data respectively. Both are part of the Java IO package.\n\n`InputStream` is used to read data from a source, such as a file, the network or the keyboard. It provides methods to read bytes, ints, and other data types from the input stream. Here's an example of using an `InputStream` to read the contents of a file:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FileInputStream;\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.io.IOError;\n\npublic class InputStreamExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String filePath = \"example.txt\";\n\n        try (FileInputStream input = new FileInputStream(filePath)) {\n            int data = input.read();\n            while (data != -1) {\n                System.out.print((char) data);\n                data = input.read();\n            }\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n            throw new IOError(\"File not found\", e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`OutputStream` is used to write data to a destination, such as a file or the console. It provides methods to write bytes, ints, and other data types to the output stream. Here's an example of using an `OutputStream` to write data to a file:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FileOutputStream;\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class OutputStreamExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String filePath = \"output.txt\";\n        String data = \"Hello, World!\";\n\n        try (FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(filePath)) {\n            output.write(data.getBytes());\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"File not found\", e);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"Error writing to file\", e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, `InputStream` is used to read data from a source, while `OutputStream` is used to write data to a destination. To read or write specific data types, you can use the corresponding methods such as `read()` or `write()` for bytes, `readInt()` or `writeInt()` for ints, and so on.\n\nIt is recommended to use try-with-resources when working with these classes to ensure that input and output streams are closed properly when the code exits the block, avoiding potential resource leaks."}
{"question": "I read somewhere that C\u266f and D\u266d actually differ 41 by cents from each other. As far as I know, there should be 2 semitones between C and D. Moreover, C\u266f is one semitone above C and D\u266d is one semitone below D. Therefore, C\u266f and D\u266d should be equivalent. If so, how can C\u266f and D\u266d actually differ by 41 cents from each other?", "answer": "When we talk about the exact frequencies of each pitch class, we have to know the temperament, and a reference pitch. For example, 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) with A4=440Hz is a standard in modern music. From those two parameters, we can extrapolate the exact frequency of every possible note.\n\n12TET is nearly ubiquitous nowadays (at least in Western music), but it doesn't sound as clean as Just Intonation (JI). In essence, 12TET has made every key sound equally imperfect. JI creates a scale where the intervals in the primary chords are all very nice simple ratios, and so the chords ring out very cleanly, but it only works in that key. Important note: within a given JI tuning, each of the 12 pitch classes still has only one single frequency. There is no difference between C\u266f and D\u266d in, say, \"Pythagorean tuning based on A, with A=440Hz\".\n\nBut most music doesn't stay in one key. While a piano can't make pitch adjustments on the fly (which is why we've agreed to use 12TET for it), most instruments in an orchestra can. So when the piece is in A major, the orchestra will use JI and adjust C\u266f to be a little flatter than it would be if using 12TET. But then if the piece modulates to F\u266f minor, they'll start playing it slightly sharp.\n\nWhen people say that C\u266f is not the same as D\u266d, what they really mean (whether they realize it or not) is that context may make for different micro-adjustments. In C major, a C\u266f might be the third of an A major chord, perhaps a secondary dominant of the ii chord, while D\u266d might be the root of the Neapolitan chord. These would result in different tuning choices.", "prediction_0": "You're correct that in the equal temperament tuning system, which is commonly used in modern music, a major second interval consisting of two semitones is equivalent to 100 cents. Therefore, C and D should be separated by 100 cents, and C\u266f and D\u266d should respectively be a semitone above or below these notes, with a separation of either 100 or 200 cents (depending on which note is considered the base).\n\nThe statement that C\u266f and D\u266d differ by 41 cents is actually an anomaly that arises from the specific tuning calculations used in certain tuning systems, such as quarter-comma meantone tuning, which was commonly used in the Baroque era. In this system, C\u266f and D\u266d are separated by slightly more than a semitone, which results in a difference of approximately 41 cents.\n\nHowever, modern music generally uses equal temperament tuning, which eliminates these slight discrepancies and treats C\u266f and D\u266d as equivalent notes with a consistent Major Second interval of exactly 100 cents. If you're working in modern music theory, you can safely assume that C\u266f and D\u266d are equivalent.", "prediction_1": "The difference in pitch between C\u266f and D\u266d is indeed typically considered to be one semitone or 100 cents. However, the 12-tone equal temperament system that is commonly used in modern music and tuning systems does result in a very slight discrepancy in pitch between these two notes.\n\nEqual temperament divides the octave into 12 equal semitones, each semitone being a logarithmic interval of approximately 100 cents (or 1/12th of an octave). However, the ratios of the frequencies of the twelve pitches in an octave according to pure tuning (also known as just intonation) do not result in exactly 100 cents between each semitone.\n\nThe difference in frequency between C\u266f and D\u266d in equal temperament is approximately 41.6 cents. This is a result of the slight imperfection of equal temperament as a tuning system, which is used to simplify tuning and make every interval a simple ratio (for example, every major third is exactly 1.25 times the frequency of the root note).\n\nSo while theoretically C\u266f and D\u266d should be the same pitch (since they are a semitone apart), due to the imperfections of equal temperament, they are actually slightly different in pitch. The difference of 41 cents may not be noticeable in most cases, but it can add up when working with complex harmonies and intervals. If more precise tuning is required, other tuning systems such as just intonation or microtonal systems can be used to achieve more accurate pitches between notes.", "prediction_2": "While it is true that C, C\u266f, and D form a perfect fourth interval, consisting of exactly two semitones or twelve equal tempered cents, the difference between C\u266f and D\u266d is indeed approximately 41 cents in equal temperament. This is a consequence of the way equal temperament interacts with just intonation, the historical tuning system based on perfect intervals and ratios.\n\nIn just intonation, C\u266f and D\u266d are indeed derived from the same fundamental frequency by applying the ratios 13/12 to C and 11/8 to D, respectively (for the major third C\u266f and the minor third D\u266d in the key of C major). In this system, C\u266f and D\u266d represent distinct pitches and are not exactly equivalent. However, when using the equal tempered tuning system, which involves dividing the octave into 12 equal parts of 100 cents each, the distance between C\u266f and D\u266d, as well as all other intervals, are adjusted to approximate the frequencies that correspond to the ratios of the justly tuned intervals. However, in doing so, the perfect correspondence between C\u266f and D\u266d in the context of just intonation is lost and, instead, they become slightly different pitches that are approximately 41 cents apart.\n\nIn summary, while C, C\u266f, and D form a just interval of two semitones in both absolute and relative terms, the difference in frequency between C\u266f and D\u266d in equal temperament is approximately 41 cents due to the adjustments required to tune all intervals as equal parts of the octave.", "prediction_3": "The difference between C\u266f and D\u266d in terms of frequency ratios is indeed only one semitone, which corresponds to a ratio of 1.122462050525317. However, the difference in pitch perception between these two notes is not exactly 100 cents (one semitone) due to the properties of human hearing and the way our tone systems are designed.\n\nEqual temperament, which is the most commonly used tuning system in Western music, divides the octave into twelve equal semitones, each consisting of 100 cents. This system simplifies tuning and harmony calculations, but it does not perfectly represent the natural harmonic series, which underlies the perception of many tonal qualities. In practice, some intervals may sound slightly sharp or flat when played using equal temperament.\n\nWhen comparing C\u266f and D\u266d, in an equal temperament tuned piano, these notes will differ by approximately 41.66 cents, which is slightly less than 41 cents you mentioned. This tiny difference results from the fact that the perfect fifth (in this case, G - C) is actually closer to being 7 semitones in a perfect fifth harmonic series than the ideal 5 equal semitones of equal temperament (12 x 1/12^3 = 1.469:1). Thus, to maintain this discrepancy, the minor third interval (in this case, C - E, or, in this context, C - D\u266d) will be slightly smaller than expected.\n\nWhile the difference between C\u266f and D\u266d might seem insignificant, this discrepancy can result in noticeable differences when playing complex piano compositions or in larger ensemble settings, such as orchestras, when multiple notes must be played simultaneously. In such cases, the use of just intonation or quarter-comma meantone temperaments can help minimize the perceived deviations in tuning and potentially improve the overall sonic quality.\n\nIn summary, the perceived difference of 41 cents between C\u266f and D\u266d in terms of cents is not entirely accurate. The actual difference is closer to 41.66 cents in an equal temperament tuned piano, but the underlying reason for this disparity is the imperfections in our tuning systems compared to the harmonic series upon which music is based.", "prediction_4": "It is true that in equal temperament, which is the standard tuning system used in modern music, there are exactly two semitones between C and D, and C\u266f is a semitone above C, while D\u266d is a semitone below D. However, the difference between C\u266f and D\u266d in cents is not exactly 0, but rather around 41.1 cents.\n\nThis discrepancy can be explained by the nature of equal temperament itself. In this tuning system, each semitone is divided into 100 cents. The perfect fifth (seven semitones) is then tuned to be exactly 700 cents. This results in some small inaccuracies in the frequencies of the individual notes.\n\nThe specific difference between C\u266f and D\u266d in equal temperament is due to the fact that C\u266f is a major third above A, which is a semitone below C, while D\u266d is a major third below F, which is a semitone above D. The major third interval is slightly larger than a perfect fifth divided by 1.5 (which would be the ideal ratio for a major third), resulting in a slight difference in frequency between C\u266f and D\u266d.\n\nTherefore, while C\u266f and D\u266d are equivalent in terms of their relationship to the C major scale, they do not have exactly the same frequency in equal temperament tuning. This difference of around 41.1 cents is a characteristic of equal temperament tuning and is not a problem in most musical contexts."}
